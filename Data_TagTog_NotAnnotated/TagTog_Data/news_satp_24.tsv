26735	2013	5	india	Dawood Ibrahim and his network of bogus hawala (illegal money transfer) firms, spread across India, have been covertly financing Indian Mujahideen (IM’s) network in India, said sources in the central agencies and counter terrorism units investigating blast cases across the country, Hindustan Times reports on May 3. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has been informed of Dawood’s alleged extensive hawala network in the Middle East and South Asian countries. A detailed probe by the Anti Money Laundering Suspicious Cases Unit (AMLU) is underway in the Middle East, sources said. The involvement of Dawood in financing terror through his network of hawala firms was unearthed during investigations into the July 13, 2011 blasts in Mumbai, (where the IM was allegedly involved) said sources in central agencies and counter terrorism units. Many key players in the attacks are suspected to have links with Dawood. A sum of INR 10, 00, 000 had been sent by alleged hawala operator Muzzafar Kola to IM kingpin Yasin Bhatkal through Delhi based Kanwar Nain Pathrija, Police sources said. The investigating agencies then suspected the involvement of the D Company and intercepted telephone conversations from across the border showed directions being given to certain people, along with details of the money flow and transfers through hawala transactions. Kola, sources said, was a Mustafa Dossa man who later became a Dawood associate. These reports led agencies to believe that Bhatkal, a Fazal ur Rehman gang member who now heads the IM, was working closely with Dawood and his company.Fazal ur Rehman, too, was a close aide of Dawood and was arrested in 2006. Bhatkal, Police sources believe, took up the reins of Fazal’s network after that. “Kola is one of the wanted accused in the 13 7 blasts case for his alleged involvement in the hawala transfer and is also involved in money laundering,” said a senior police officer. Dawood’s intricate network of hawala transactions and its use for financing terror dates back to 2001, when Partho Roy Burman was kidnapped in Kolkata (West Bengal), and a ransom of 37.5 million was transferred to Dubai through Dawood’s hawala channel. Investigators said that Kola was responsible even for the money transfer in Burman’s kidnapping case.

57661	2011	9	india	Stating that India requires a comprehensive counter terrorism strategy, Home Minister P Chidambaram on September 15 said that he hoped to secure a Government decision on setting up the long pending National Counter Terrorism Centre to help tackle multiple threats including home grown terror, according to The Times of India. Speaking to State Police Chiefs and intelligence officials in a conference in New Delhi, Chidambaram said the two recent bomb blasts in Mumbai and Delhi are a blot on the Government s record. Chidambaram said terrorist groups based in Pakistan continued to target India, but Indian modules were a reality as were groups that espouse the cause of right wing religious fundamentalism or separatism. Many of them, he said, have acquired the capacity to make bombs. On the crucial aspect of capacity building to tackle terrorism, he said the most important unfinished agenda is NCTC. I hope to secure a government decision on setting up the NCTC. Once there is a decision, I am confident the core team of NCTC can be installed within 60 days and the full structure can be put together within 12 18 months. Pointing to the wide arc of threats India needs to deal with, Chidambaram said There is no let up in attempts to infiltrate from across the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir. Besides, there are attempts to infiltrate terrorists via Nepal and Bangladesh into India as well as find a safe transit route from Sri Lanka to Tamil Nadu. Referring to the threat of Hindutva (right wing militant Hindu extremist) groups, the Home Minister said There are other Indian modules that espouse the cause of right wing religious fundamentalism or separatism. Many of these modules have acquired the capacity to make bombs. He added that no country in the world, including the United States, appears to be entirely immune to the threat of terror, the worst affected being Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. While listing out the steps taken by the government to build capacity to deal with all kinds of threats after the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, he said, Have we done enough to build capacity since the Mumbai terror attacks The answer is yes and no.....we have not done enough...there are still over 5,00,000 vacancies in state police forces. He also asked Police forces across the country to revisit the standard operating procedures in dealing with public protests and use only non lethal methods to control civil disturbances, including stone pelting.

17659	2014	11	india	The Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist) has warned journalists working in Chhattisgarh against helping the Police in carrying out surrender of Maoist cadres, reports The Hindu on November 2. “We appeal to the journalist brothers to condemn the fake surrenders and stop encouraging those who have deceived the people’s movement. The journalists who support the surrendered Maoists will be termed as ‘anti people’ by the party,” said Ganesh Uike, ‘secretary’ of the South Regional Committee (SRC) of the CPI Maoist, in a press statement. The Maoist leader criticised senior journalist and president of Bastar press club Karrimuddin for giving “financial assistance” to a surrendered Maoist cadre a few days ago. “Karrimuddin is a senior journalist. It does not behove him to encourage those (surrendered Maoists) who have deceived the people’s movement. He should not repeat this,” said the Maoist leader.The SRC secretary termed the spate of Maoist surrenders in Bastar in the past few months as “fake and engineered”. “The new surrender policy is acting as a tool for corrupt police and paramilitary officers to loot money. The police and administration is misleading the media about surrenders. Common people and activists working in Bastar are threatened with arrest and are asked to pose as surrendered Maoists. In many cases, former Maoists, who quit the party many years ago, are being re arrested,” claimed Ganesh Uike, whose name has figured in almost all the major incidents of violence against police in the last five to 10 years.Uike alleged that in the past few months Bastar police and paramilitary forces had killed many civilians and branded them as Maoists. “Three women members of the PLGA were caught and tortured before being killed. Bastar Inspector General of Police (IGP) S.R.P. Kalluri is misleading the media. The journalists should not believe the police version on surrenders and encounters. We appeal our journalist brothers to come to the spot and verify facts before writing,” added the press statement.The Maoists party secretary also appealed the journalists to stop “defaming” the CPI (Maoist) for “red terror”. “We are not terrorists, but we are patriots and we are fighting for the people. We are standing against many multinational companies, preventing them from snatching land from tribal people. The media should support us rather than supporting the ‘exploiter’ government,” said the Maoist leader calling for “Dandakaranya bandh” on November 8 against the Narendra Modi government’s “Brahmnic and fascist policies”.Karrimuddin has denied the allegations and said that he was just giving reward money to a surrendered Maoist at a ceremony.

Khwaja, also known as Ziauddin Butt, allegedly said that Bin Laden’s safe house in Abbottabad “was made to order” by Brigadier Ijaz Shah, a former head of the Intelligence Bureau. “Ziauddin says Ijaz Shah was responsible for setting up Bin Laden in Abbottabad, ensuring his safety and keeping him hidden from the outside. And Ziauddin says Musharraf knew all about it,” Riedel wrote in the article. Shah, who the assassinated Premier Benazir Bhutto had linked to a failed plot to kill her, has been closely linked to Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British born Kashmiri terrorist who was imprisoned in India in 1994 for kidnapping three Britons and an American. Saeed was part of the plot to kidnap journalist Daniel Pearl and turned himself in to Shah.

5156	2015	8	india	Investigators working to identify Dawood Ibrahim s offshore assets have found his involvement in the business of conflict diamonds, The Times of India reports on August 30. In a bid to freeze Dawood s assets and shamble his operations, National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval had tasked intelligence agencies to pinpoint the his businesses. It is widely known that he has interests in real estate, money laundering, hawala (illegal money transaction) betting and fake currencies. Investigators have found that the current focus of the D Company, is to promote and expand the business of conflict diamonds in Africa and Dubai. Conflict diamonds are raw diamonds mined and sold by militants groups in African countries, particularly Angola, Sierra Leone and Congo, to finance conflict aimed at undermining legitimate governments . These illegally mined stones are also called blood diamonds for the millions of civilian deaths caused by arms and ammunition that their sales have procured. They have largely been blacklisted in the diamond markets across the world. Dawood s numerous links to countries such as Zimbabwe and Kenya, among others, have been detailed in a dossier created by the investigators. It also describes the manner in which the gangster s syndicate acquires diamonds abroad and smuggles them into Dubai. The dossier talks about a conduit called Rehmat, who appears to be Dawood s pointman in Africa. Rehmat, who uses a mobile phone with an African number, hires African nationals, mostly women and young men, to act as couriers for Dawood s diamonds. Rehmat is known to have tapped the existing couriers to identify those who could carry the diamonds to the don s henchmen in Dubai. The intelligence investigators have established that Dawood has a Dubai based company called Al Noor Diamonds which, they say, is a front for this illegal trade in blood diamonds. The probe has uncovered solid evidence to show how Rehmat ferries diamonds to Dubai from Africa on flights. On each trip, diamonds worth around 5,00,000 to 10,00,000 USD are smuggled into Dubai and the African courier is paid 10,000 USD as his courier fee, reads the dossier. In Dubai, a man named in the report as Feroze Oasis receives the stones and has them processed before putting them out on the market. Feroze also handles Dawood s other companies viz Oasis Oil and Lube LCC ... He is a south Indian and speaks Tamil, Arabic, English and Hindi, the dossier reads. The investigators say Javed Chutani alias Doctor is the man who oversees Dawood s operations and business in Dubai. He was a bookie by profession with interests in real estate. His current gambling book is in the name of Kamran. Chutani also works as a bridge between Feroze, another associate Tariq Dubai and Dawood, the dossier states. The agencies are now probing the Indian links of the syndicate which they suspect get active once the rocks are processed and ready to be sold. India is a major processor of diamonds almost 10 of every 11 diamonds that are sold across the globe are cut and polished in the country.

Acharya said his party took the initiative to hold talks with the United Democratic Madhesi Front (UDMF) and narrowed down differences. “I think an agreement is possible on the constitution amendment bill and even on provincial boundaries UDMF is ready to wait but they want a guarantee that provincial boundaries will be changed,” Acharya said. UCPN Maoist leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha said he regretted that the talks between the major parties and the UDMF were not happening. “Major parties and the government should intensify their efforts to seek a negotiated settlement to resolve the Tarai unrest,” he added. A UCPN M source said the CPN UML was proving to be the stumbling block to a negotiated settlement to end the Tarai unrest. “I don’t think that this government will resolve the Tarai unrest,” the source added.

9767	2015	1	nepal	The Unified Communist Party of Nepal Maoist (UCPN M) is preparing to intensify protests within the Constituent Assembly (CA) and on the streets as the January 22 constitution promulgation deadline approaches, reports Ekantipur.com on January 16. The opposition party also urged the ruling coalition to suspend its plan of settling contentious issues through a vote in the CA arguing that the document of far reaching consequence should be drafted on the basis of consensus among the major stakeholders. The opposition’s immediate priority is to delay the CA process as long as possible so that the ruling parties’ plan to bring out a preliminary draft of the new constitution within a week could be foiled, leaders said. If the deadline is averted, party leaders say, it would be easy to deal with the new circumstances. Inside the CA, the party plans to keep its alliance with the Madhesi parties intact, and hold discussions with other forces to convince them that they should not resort to voting to decide contentious issues. Outside the CA, the UCPN M has formed an alliance with the breakaway Communist Party of Nepal Maoist (CPN Maoist) and Janajati groups and organisations to bolster its position through street agitation. The party is against the idea of preparing a questionnaire on the disputed issues for clause wise voting in the Assembly. As the CA chairman intends to form a special taskforce to prepare the questionnaire, the party said it would not accept the move. “It’s the responsibility of the Political Dialogue and Consensus Committee (PDCC) to forge consensus or prepare questionnaire on the issues,” said UCPN M spokesman Dina Nath Sharma. The PDCC led by Maoist leader Baburam Bhattarai failed in the past to find a way out. A meeting of top Maoist leaders, however, concluded that they should be prepared to counter the strategy of the ruling parties as they plan to use their majority in the Assembly to decide issues as per their principles.
