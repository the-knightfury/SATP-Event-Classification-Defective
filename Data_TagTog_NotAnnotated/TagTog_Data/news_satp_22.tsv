6732	2015	12	india	There are five takeaways from the Bangkok meeting of the India s National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and his Pakistani counterpart, Nasir Janjua, and foreign secretaries, S Jaishankar and Aizaz Ahmed held on December 6, at Bangkok, Thailand, reports The Times of India. First, both countries are done with their grandstanding, and after months of harsh rhetoric and a diplomatic sulk, they have come to the conclusion that engagement is the better part of valour. Second, both countries climbed down to make this happen. India needed talks to be on terrorism, which it was. Doval and Janjua discussed all aspects of terror and instability, including looking at the Kashmir issue from the terror angle. On the other hand, India gave in to a Pakistani demand to hold simultaneous Foreign Secretary level talks on Kashmir. Third, meeting in Bangkok overcomes the Hurriyat hurdle. The Pakistanis are spared the pressure of meeting the separatists and the Indians are spared the necessity of shutting that down. Fourth, a third country keeps an intrusive, polarized and high decibel sub continental media at bay. Over the years, successive Indian and Pakistani governments have blamed the media for vitiating the atmosphere and making things difficult for them. Fifth, the talks prepares the ground for India s Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj s trip to Islamabad next week. Modi is now more than likely to be in Islamabad for the SAARC summit in 2016. In addition, India can remove the bilateral problem from the table when the world discusses a solution to Afghanistan.

Referring to the 1962 India China war, the ULFA I leader said the People s Liberation Army had not set foot on Assam soil and he is amazed at China s respect for Assam. Since then, I have been observing China closely and, in my best judgment, I have not seen any enmity towards Assam yet. In absence of enmity, building friendship should be easy. But, without taking a first step, there won t be any progress. The watershed moment has arrived for indigenous Assam to prompt us to build that friendship with China with confidence. We sincerely hope that China will put forward the hand of friendship towards Assam without hesitation.

2930	2015	5	india	Government of India (GoI) is of the view that there would not be any serious security threat to the country even if the militant groups of North East, who have bases in Myanmar, join hands, and the security agencies are fully capable of handling such a situation, reports The Assam Tribune on May 3.

Most of the militant groups of the North East are based in Taga area of Myanmar and the Indian security agencies know their strengths and weaknesses. The militants have been staying in Taga together for the past decade or so. MHA sources further said that the militants groups of the North East had earlier formed a joint platform called Indo Burma Revolutionary Front and at that time, all the outfits were at their peak. But even that effort failed and the Front later disintegrated.

50948	2012	11	pakistan	The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on November 22 condemned the killing of about 25 innocent citizens on the grounds of their belief and called for serious efforts to subdue the monster of sectarianism. HRCP statement read, “No words are strong enough to condemn the November 21, 2012 killing spree in which around 25 innocent Pakistanis were slaughtered while performing belief related rituals. Quite obviously the targeting of the Shia citizens has reached a new high this year and many quarters apprehend more bloodshed on Ashura (10th Muharram). The virus of sectarianism that has been eating into the vitals of the Pakistan society can be exorcised neither by politicians’ hackneyed rhetoric nor by the antics of ineffective Law Enforcement Agencies. Everybody knows who the Shia baiters are and what new theories to justify murder on account of religious or sectarian differences the latest crop of jihadis have spawned. Thus, while the administration must do all it can to deal with the crime part of the sectarian militants’ agenda, and prove that their actions can match their proclamations, the leaders of the various schools of religious thought must admit their failure to keep their followers under some discipline. They must seriously work towards reviving the indigenous traditions of tolerance, for they are as much responsible for making Pakistan unlivable as anyone else.”

Realistically, this agenda may not yield great fruit by the end of 2014, but it is still the right way to play for the long run, said the 16 page report.

35223	2013	10	pakistan	The Law Enforcement Agencies will start a door to door drive for recovery of illegal arms since the deadline for surrendering such weapons had expired and only 19 guns were collected, Sindh Advocate General Khalid Javed Khan told the Supreme Court on October 30, reported The Express Tribune. During the 14 day deadline, from September 27, 2013 to October 12, 2013 only 19 guns were deposited with the authorities. He conceded before the apex court’s larger bench, which was hearing the Karachi law and order suo motu case at the Karachi registry, that the first phase of the campaign had yielded no positive results as citizens did not come forward. He, however, expressed confidence that the second phase would be more successful. The Surrender of Illicit Arms Act 1991 empowers law enforcers to get publicised notices, asking the citizens to deposit the weapons they possess unlawfully to avoid legal action. Once the deadline of a certain period expires, the law enforcers can forcibly recover the illegal weapons from citizens. For this purpose, door to door raids can be conducted, while curfew can also be imposed in certain localities to make it a success. The Supreme Court also directed the Chief Collector Customs Prevention Nasir Masroor to submit a detailed report regarding the large number of smuggled arms and ammunitions that have been lying at the port premises since 1994. The commission, appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate the Director General Rangers allegations regarding a missing shipload of arms and ammunitions, had conducted inquiry to see whether the weapons were smuggled through the sea and the role of customs authorities in the scam. According to the commission’s report, a large number of weapon consignments smuggled into the country back in 1994 were confiscated by the authorities. “The cache of arms is still lying on the port premises in the custody of the Karachi Port Trust,” the chief collector confirmed the commission’s report. “We are sitting on a volcano,” remarked the bench, citing that the whole city was full of these illicit arms and ammunitions and drugs. “But none is ready to take up the responsibility,” they added. The customs authorities were directed to submit a report about the number of arms seized on October 31 (today), when the matter would be taken up again.

5520	2015	9	india	The Indian Army and Assam Police on September 18 launched their biggest operation ‘Operation All Out’ against Bodo militant outfit IK Songbijit faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB IKS), particularly in places close to the international border with Bhutan, reports The Shillong Times. Assam Director General of Police (DGP) Khagen Sarma, after reviewing the security scenario in Chirang District on September 19 said that “We launched the biggest operation against the NDFB militants yesterday (September 18). In today’s (September 19) meeting, we discussed the measures to be taken against them.” The operation against the NDFB IKS has been launched in areas under the Bodoland Territorial Area Districts (BTAD) in Assam. Indian Air Force is involved in ‘Operation All Out,’ operating since January, along with the Army, Paramilitary Forces and State Police to eliminate NDFB IKS militants. DGP said NDFB IKS commander B. Bidai, who was involved in the massacre of Adivasis in December 2014, has gone into hiding. “It is difficult to find out someone if he goes into hiding, particularly due to the forest areas, which works in their favour. But if he comes out and tries to attack the security forces, we are going to catch him,” Sarma said. Some NDFB cadres were still in Myanmar and the Security Forces (SFs) were taking maximum precautions so that the militants are not able to enter India, he added.Lieutenant General Chand added that the operation has been intensified, especially along the Bhutan border, the forest areas of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Sonitpur with the deployment of approximately 4,000 security personnel since January 2015, adds The Shillong Times. “As a result of these sustained and surgical intelligence based operations, 18 terrorists were neutralised, 539 terrorists or overground workers were apprehended, and 175 assorted weapons, 180 hand grenades and seven IEDs were seized,” he said.Also, an upsurge of Islamic fundamentalism in Assam to avenge violence against minorities in the BTAD has become a challenge for the SFs, reports The Telegraph on September 20. Report said that the recent busting of a jihadi training centre and the recovery of arms in Chirang District are the latest pointers to this emerging threat. The training centre was being run under the guise of a martial arts school to escape the prying eyes of security agencies. “Formation of a new militant outfit called the Muslim Tiger Force of Assam (MTFA) to take revenge for killing of minorities in the BTAD is another cause of concern for the security establishments,” a Police source said. Two MTFA militants were arrested by the army from Gossaigaon in Kokrajhar District on September 18 and one 7.65mm rifle was recovered from them. According to Assam DGP Khagen Sarma, threat from Islamic fundamentalist forces is higher than that from local outfits like the NDFB IKS because of the former’s pan Islamic links. Sarma said during investigations into the activities of Jamaat ul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in connection with the Burdwan blast, it had come to light that some key leaders of Islamic fundamentalist organisations had visited minority dominated areas in lower Assam. He said the recent arrest of four Islamic fundamentalists from Chirang district has provided some fresh leads about their activities.

In a reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha on March 20, Union Minister of State (MoS) for Home Affairs RPN Singh said, “The Assam Arunachal border has emerged as another theatre for Maoist activities. The CPI (Maoist) are trying to establish organizational base in the Northeast with a view to forge relations with other insurgent groups to meet its military requirements.” According to him, while Maoist activities have been reported in 2012 in Dhemaji and Tinsukia Districts of Assam, Maoist influence has been noticed in Dibrugarh, Sonitpur and Chirang Districts. The movement of the Maoists have also been reported in Lohit and lower Dibang valley Districts of Arunachal Pradesh.

The UALC is also engaged in recruitment and training of cadres of militant outfits in Assam. The foray of CPI (Maoist) into the sensitive north eastern States is fraught with serious strategic implications since it has potential trans border possibilities. MoS for Home affairs RPN Singh further said that the Centre has alerted the State Governments concerned in this regard. The Home Ministry is also monitoring the situation closely and is sending advisories, as and when required, based on intelligence inputs, the Minister added.
36902	2013	5	srilanka	Reacting to a report published in the Udayan newspaper on May 28 saying that the TNA had written to President Mahinda Rajapaksa protesting against moves to erect a Budu Medura near the entrance to the Batticaloa Municipal Council premises, Eastern Province Security Forces Commander Major General Lal Perera condemned this news report and said the people in this country had the freedom to profess and follow any religion wherever they lived. This applied to the members of the security forces too, reported Daily News on May 31. This is a unitary country which had not carved out any particular area or part of this country to a special segment of society or community irrespective of what certain politicians might do, he said. Perera said it was the TNA which tried to rekindle communalism by creating problems among religions. The TNA wanted to create another communal conflict somehow. It is the present government which renovated the kovils of Tamils devastated due to terrorism after the war ended, the Major General said. Did the people of the North enjoy the freedom to follow their religion under the de facto rule of the LTTE Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) terrorists he asked. The LTTE did not allow the Tamils to live peacefully even in their homes let alone follow any religion, he said. He said by writing such letters, the TNA was trying to ignite communal clashes. There was suspicion among ordinary Tamils as to whether the TNA was scheming to take the country back to war by creating religious tensions, said General Perera. He said at a time when massive development projects were unfolding in the North and East, the Udayan paper and certain Tamil political parties and groups were trying to satisfy the Tamil Diaspora abroad by arousing communal tension harping over some topic. But he said he was certain that ordinary Tamils in the North and East would never leave room for the Tamil Diaspora to achieve its sinister motives.

30985	2013	12	india	The increasing use of an exclusive and underground Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application by suspected terrorists has increased concern among the Indian security establishment which believes it to be a creation of the Pakistani spy agency Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), Hindustan Times reports on December 3. The clandestine, Skype like application being used by suspected terrorists is hosted on anonymous servers, hidden behind security walls, that operate underground and cannot be intercepted through legal means. The recent annual meeting of the Directors General of Police (DGPs) was told that this anonymous platform was probably developed by the ISI for communication between terror outfit Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) cadres and their handlers. The access to platform is restricted to those who have been allotted a login and password, according to officials familiar with the developments. Indian Mujahideen s (IM) arrested ‘India operations chief’ Yasin Bhatkal, while sitting in Nepal, was using VoIP platforms to contact his associate Riyaz Bhatkal, who is in Karachi, Pakistan. The ISI developed VoIP service has been in use for more than a year. There are software available to develop private and exclusive VoIP service. It is quite possible that the ISI may have tweaked the software to suit its requirements. Such kind of service is always distributed on many servers and kept anonymous. Usually security layers of VPN or virtual private network and proxy tunnels are used as an additional security, says Dhruv Soi, director of Torrid Networks, a cyber security company.

Kristensen said that Pakistan s tactical nuclear weapons were intended more for use against a large Indian conventional invasion and occupation of Pakistani territory and not any limited anti terror operation on Pakistani territory. One of the most controversial new nuclear capable missiles in the Pakistani arsenal is the NASR (Hatf 9), a short range, solid fuel missile with a range of only 60 kilometer (37 miles). With a range too short to attack strategic targets inside India, NASR appears intended for battlefield use against invading Indian troops, says the report.

43408	2012	9	india	Calling Indian Mujahedeen (IM) a start to finish jihad factory , security agencies have asked country s Police brass to watch out for the outfit, which continues to be on a talent scouting spree, emboldened by tacit support of Pakistan s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and its labyrinthine networks in various cities of Uttar Pradesh (UP), Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Delhi, reports The Times of India. Referring to 40 missing youth of Maharashtra, who might have gone underground after joining IM, the central agencies asked top Policemen to look for their whereabouts. It is suspected that some of the youth might have joined the outfit during its routine recruitment drive. While innocuous religious platforms like Quran Foundation, Pune (Maharashtra) and Islamic Guidance Centre, Mangalore (Karnataka), among other similar institutions are happy hunting ground for its cadres, IM s primary targets are disenchanted Muslim youth —ranging from petty criminals to well heeled software professionals. The agencies, in their presentation on IM, noted that recruitment of IT professional Mansoor Ali Mohammed Peerbhoy was a prized catch for the outfit. He was enlisted while he studying Arabic at Quran Foundation. Peerbhoy, a Yahoo executive turned media chief of IM, who was arrested in 2008, had lured a number of educated youth to IM s fold. Recruitments of Arif Badar, improvised explosive device (IED) assembly and micro chip based timer expert, and Mobin, internet hacking expert, were cited as cases in point of how budding talents were identified and trained as terrorists through fiery and emotive taqrirs (speeches) and attitude hardening dars (lessons). It was noted that brainwashing through doctored pictorials and videos, such as, that of Godhra and Babri Masjid incidents was very common in taqrirs and dars. It is also noted that IM doesn t have a defined structure. Its top leaders run the show from safe havens not only in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia but also in Nepal and the UAE (Dubai and Sharjah). It has substantial corpus of money having funding sources based in Kuwait, Riyadh, Chicago and various cities in Pakistan. Though IM came to notice for the first time when it sent e mail to media houses ahead of serial blasts in Faizabad, Lucknow and Varanasi in UP in November, 2007, its genesis the note says goes back to 2000. At that time, IM was largely involved in talent spotting, motivation and training of Indian youth in Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) and ISI facilities to lend credence to the homegrown terror concept.

3404	2015	5	india	The Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist) appear to have found a new recruitment pool — Police officials engaged in anti Naxal Left Wing Extremism (LWE) operations, reports Indian Express on May 27. In a statement released by CPI Maoist spokesperson Malajulla Venugopal alias Abhay, the Maoist leadership has urged Policemen to quit their jobs and join the “revolution” to defeat the “sinister” and “fascist” designs of their seniors and political leaders. To drive home the point, the CPI Maoist has also cited incidents of “over stressed” Policemen killing their seniors and claimed that more than 1,000 Security Force (SF) personnel have been killed in anti Naxal operations. “Think about your background. You belong to the lower strata of the society. You cannot deny that you have come from families of poor tribals, labourers and farmers. Think about who you are serving just to feed your families. We know you are not honestly agreeing to the demands of the job and your family members not happy that you have to do this. Your senior officers, fraudulent politicians are trying to instill false patriotism in your minds by branding Maoists as a security threat. But, the fact is that the rate of quitting a police job is about one in three. You must understand the selfish motive of politicians to loot resources of the people,” Abhay said in the statement. The statement claims several politicians from across political parties are corrupt. It also makes a mention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the 2002 Gujarat riots. “The same Modi is now travelling around the world to sell India’s resources to foreigners in the name of Make in India. That is why leaders like Barack Obama, Stephen Harper and Angela Merkel are praising him. Your guns are actually meant to forcibly acquire farmers’ lands. Are you ready to shed your blood for these people,” Abhay said.
