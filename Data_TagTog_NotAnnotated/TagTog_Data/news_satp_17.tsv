22028	2014	12	pakistan	Umar Mansoor, a key Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) commander and a close aid of Mullah Fazlullah was the mastermind of December 16 militants’ attack on Peshawar Army Public School, The Express Tribune reports on December 20. A video posted on December 18 on a website used by the TTP shows a man with a luxuriant chest length beard, holding an admonishing finger aloft as he seeks to justify the December 16 attack. The caption identified him as Umar Mansoor. “If our women and children die as martyrs, your children will not escape,” he said. “We will fight against you in such a style that you attack us and we will take revenge on innocents.” Six TTP cadres interviewed by Reuters confirmed that the mastermind was Mansoor who is close to TTP ‘chief’ Mullah Fazlullah. “He strictly follows the principles of jihad,” one said. “He is strict in principles, but very kind to his juniors. He is popular among the juniors because of his bravery and boldness.” Mansoor got a high school education in the capital, Islamabad, two TTP members said, and later studied in a madrassah. “Umar Mansoor had a tough mind from a very young age, he was always in fights with other boys,” said one TTP cadre. Mansoor has two brothers and spent some time working in the city of Karachi as a labourer before joining the Taliban soon after it was formed, in late 2007, said one commander. His nickname is “nary,” a word in the Pashto language meaning “slim”, and he is the father of two daughters and a son, said another commander. “(Mansoor) likes to play volleyball,” said one of the Taliban members. “He is a good volleyball player. Wherever he shifts his office, he puts a volleyball net up.” The Taliban video describes him as the “amir”, or leader, of Peshawar and nearby Darra Adam Khel. Mansoor deeply opposes talks with the Government, the commanders said. “He was very strict from the start when he joined,” a commander said. “He left many commanders behind if they had a soft corner (of their heart) for the government.”

47315	2012	4	pakistan	United States (US) Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said on April 27 that there is “no silver bullet” to completely destroy al Qaeda but argued that killing Osama bin Laden helped set the network back, reports Dawn. “Having been involved in the operations, even before we did bin Laden, it’s clear that there is no kind of silver bullet here to suddenly being able to destroy al Qaeda, and that includes even going after bin Laden,” he said. “But the way this works is that the more successful we are at taking down those who represent their spiritual and ideological leadership, the greater our ability to weaken their threat to this country and to other countries,” he added further. Panetta said he was certain that America was safer as a result of the bin Laden operation. “When you combine that with the other operations that have taken place, that have gone after al Qaeda leadership, I think it really has weakened al Qaeda as an organization and certainly it has prevented them from having the command and control capability to be able to put together an attack similar to 9 11,” the Defense Secretary pointed out. However, he cautioned, that this did not mean that there was no longer a terrorism threat. “It doesn’t mean that we somehow don’t have the responsibility to keep going after them wherever they are,” Panetta said.
23101	2014	7	srilanka	Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa on July 1 ruled out any possibility that its soil could be used for terror attacks against India, after the recent discovery of an alleged terrorist plot to attack foreign missions in south India, reports Enewspaper of India.

The conspiracy was reportedly planned overseas including in Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Maldives. The plot was foiled by effective coordination of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) with countries such as Malaysia which tipped off India about the plan being hatched from Sri Lankan soil to attack the consulates in Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and Bangalore (Karnataka).

7925	2015	4	pakistan	The family of a 19 year old German boy, identified as Ali Mohammad Din, who had gone missing on February 7, 2015, in Faisalabad Districts negotiating with a group of militants based in Afghanistan to seek his return, reported Dawn on April 3 (today). The militants, affiliated with Amarat Islami in Afghanistan, conveyed to the family that Ali had joined them for jihad (holy war) and would join the Islamic State (IS also known as ISIS) in a couple of weeks.

48151	2012	6	pakistan	The Times of India while quoting the United States (US) Counterterrorism officials on June 9, reported that the death of al Qaeda s ‘Deputy leader’, Abu Yahya al Libi on June 4, 2012 is likely to accelerate a shift in power from the group s dwindling leadership in Pakistan to its increasingly autonomous franchises, particularly the branch in Yemen, whose focus on attacking American interests is sure to continue. American counterterrorism officials said Libi had played a pivotal role as the organization s theological traffic cop, enforcing a unified message and ensuring that younger fighters in the affiliates did not go off the rails. For now, Ayman al Zawahri, Qaeda s nominal leader, still holds the broad influence that he has consolidated since Osama bin Laden s death on May1 2, 2011. But the hierarchical structure of global jihad may be loosening a bit. Libi s death in a drone strike has torn at the connective tissue between the group s embattled leadership in Pakistan and its far flung affiliates across the Middle East and Africa. Libi s killing may even augur increased violence as younger, more impetuous fighters vie to seize mantle of global leadership, said analysts. Osama Bin Laden himself, in the documents that US navy SEALs recovered from his house in Abbottabad, worried about the rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced and this would lead to the repeat of mistakes.

62852	2011	10	pakistan	Islamabad on October 17 said that Afghan and US led forces had failed to hunt down Maulvi Fazlulla, a Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) cleric responsible for a spate of cross border raids despite repeated requests from Islamabad, reports Daily Times. Pakistani officials have urged the US to focus on defeating its enemies in Afghanistan instead of blaming Islamabad for its failures. “We have given locations and information about these groups to the Afghanistan Government and ISAF International Security Assistance Force , but there has been no action,” Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Major General Athar Abbas said. Fazlullah was the TTP leader in Swat Valley of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 160 kilometers northwest of Islamabad before a 2009 army offensive forced him to flee. Also known as FM Mullah for his fiery radio broadcasts, he regrouped in Afghanistan and established strongholds, and poses a threat to Pakistan once again, said Abbas. Fazlullah, a leading figure in the TTP is based in Kunar and Nuristan provinces of Afghanistan, said Abbas. “When they ran away from Swat, Fazlullah’s group was in tatters and was scattered,” Abbas said, adding, “They got time and support in Afghanistan.” However, Mansur Khan Mehsud of Islamabad’s FATA Research Centre doubts Fazlullah could take control of Swat or other areas. “While Fazlullah has the support of Afghan Taliban in the Kunar and Nuristan provinces, he has the capacity to only launch hit and run attacks,” Mehsud said.

35221	2013	10	pakistan	The Government on October 30 claimed that more than two thousand suspected terrorists have been killed in 317 drone strikes in the past five years while only 67 innocent civilians have died in these attacks, reports Dawn. The Ministry of Defence furnished a written reply in the Senate detailing the number of US drone strikes in the past five years. Surprisingly the Ministry of Defence data also claims that no innocent civilian was struck by the drone strikes since January 2012 while more than three hundred terrorists were targeted in the strikes. The official data negates the claims by local political and religious parties that US drone strikes in Pakistan have mostly killed innocent civilians, including women and children. According to the official data, this year has witnessed the lowest number of drone strikes which are 14 as compared to 2010 when the US hit Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) 115 times through drone attacks. Only three percent of 2,227 people killed in US drone strikes since 2008 were civilians, a surprisingly low figure that sparked criticism from groups that have investigated deaths from the attacks. The number is much lower than past Government calculations and estimates by independent organizations that have gone as high as 300. The Ministry said 317 drone strikes have killed 2,160 Islamic militants and 67 civilians since 2008. However, the Foreign Office said on October 31 that the Government was convinced that drone attacks were counter productive and it (FO) had sought details from the Ministry of Defence about the low non combatant casualty figure reported in Senate. “Our position on the drone strikes is very clear. We are convinced that drone strikes are counter productive,” Foreign Office spokesman Aizaz Chaudhry said at the weekly media briefing.

7221	2015	1	pakistan	Pakistan faced a range of internal security issues in 2014, resulting in a wide range of violence, including terrorism, militant attacks, sectarian violence, crimes, target killings, security operations and drone strikes, Daily Times reported on January 10. Compared to 5,687 deaths in 2013, a total of 7,655 people died in 2014 as a direct result of violence, which is an average increase of about 35 , revealed a survey conducted by Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS). The most significant increase in violence was in observed in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), where fatalities more than doubled from 1,457 in 2013 to 3,399 in 2014. A big reason for this marked increase is the military led operation Zarb e Azb in the North Waziristan Agency of the FATA region. The second largest increase was in Punjab, where death from violence rose from 120 in 2013 to 309 in 2014, a drastic increase of 158 . Part of this increase in figures may be attributed to the November 2014 bombing of the Wagah border closing ceremony, which left 60 dead. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) saw a decrease in violence related deaths, with 945 deaths in 2014, as compared to the 1,031 deaths in 2013. Gilgit Baltistan (GB) saw the largest decrease in violence related casualties, at 3 in 2014, from 20 in 2013. The sudden spike from June 2014 onwards is clearly attributable to the start of Operation Zarb e Azb. Deaths from violence accelerated towards the end of the year, pulling significantly ahead of the same month figures from 2013. The last three months in 2014 were especially bloody, with an alarming 258 increase from the same period in 2013.

794	2015	12	bangladesh	Organisations like the Jama atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) have been operating under instructions from Pakistan s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) to create chaos in India s eastern sector, Bangladeshi officials said, reports The Times of India on December 21. According to officials in Bangladesh, the ISI has been as active in that country as it has been India in the last couple of years. In January this year (2015), Mazhar Khan, a Pakistani envoy was expelled from Dhaka for allegedly funding JMB operatives. With operations getting more difficult in Jammu Kashmir, the ISI has apparently turned its attention to Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. The ISI is exploiting efforts by the JMB and other organisations to create unrest both in Bangladesh and the eastern states of India. West Bengal is primary in the scheme of things as there has been long standing talk of jihadi outfits planning a Caliphate in Bangladesh after incorporating the districts of Malda, Murshidabad and Nadia of West Bengal. Pakistan and the ISI in particular has a lot to gain from the acts of violence perpetrated by the terror outfits. Historically, the Liberation of Bangladesh has been a sore wound for the Pakistani establishment. Improved ties between India and Bangladesh amount to rubbing salt on this wound. By creating trouble in this region, Pakistan can make both Bangladesh and India suffer as unlike in northern India, the borders in the east are more porous, a senior Bangladeshi official noted.

6940	2015	12	india	Dawood Ibrahim, is the brain behind smuggling Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) from Bangladesh to West Bengal with the support of his mentors in Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), New Indian Express reports on December 20. Earlier, Bangladeshi officials arrested six men from near Dhaka airport and seized several crores of FICN. Among the arrested was Pakistani national Abdullah alias Salim. Interrogation revealed that their boss was Dawood Ibrahim, and that D Company (as his gang is called) has a network in Malda District and in some border districts of West Bengal. Investigation revealed that Abdullah migrated to Karachi with his family in 1979 from Tarpurchandi in Chandpur in Bangladesh. He joined D Company through Aslam Chaudhury alias Taimur, and kept in touch with the “manager of FICN smuggling” Subabhai alias Ershad.Abdullah revealed that during the last six years, the smuggling of thousands of crores of FICN to Malda from Chapainawabgunj District in Bangladesh was controlled by Iqbal Kana alias Adis Iqbal alias Malikbhai of D Company, a resident of Shalimar Gate in Lahore. Malikbhai vetted each recruit before engaging them in smuggling FICN from printing presses in Nepal to Bangladesh and then into West Bengal. There were several printing presses in Lahore and Karachi too, he said. Five others who were arrested said that Bengalis in Pakistan who did not have passports and wanted to return to Bangladesh were being recruited. D Company arranged “out passes” for them through the Bangladesh High Commission in Pakistan. They carried trunk loads of FICN, which was allowed to pass through the green channel at Dhaka airport by D Company and ISI officials. The NIA (National Investigation Agency) was informed that a FICN “stock yard” existed in Shibgunj and Daulatpur in Malda, which is managed by Saddam Sheikh. The modus operandi was to sell INR 100,000 of FICN for INR 40,000 to businessmen. The profit from smuggling FICN is sent through Karmakar, a hawala (illegal money transaction) operator in Malda, to D Company’s agents in Kajipara, Mirpur, Gabtuli and Gulshan in Dhaka. The thousands of crores of rupees are then routed to Dawood in Karachi and Lahore.

It further states that the violence is not limited to killings, many more journalists have escaped assassination attempts or been threatened, harassed, abducted or tortured. The threat by the militant groups, including the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), spreads from Karachi (Sindh) to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and the tribal areas. In those conflict ridden regions as well as Balochistan, these groups and ethnic Baloch armed groups openly threaten reporters with death and attack them.

Griffiths added, “The range of threats means that journalists are placed in an impossible position, where virtually every story could put them at risk of reprisal from several sides. It also has a chilling effect on freedom of expression and is increasingly leading to self censorship .

The seized explosives, which also include detonators and gelatins, are similar to the ones that terrorist sleeper cells use. There is no destination other than a terrorist sleeper cell where such explosives could be sent, said Police. Maoists usually do not use timer bombs to carry attacks on security personnel. Police Spokesperson S N Pradhan said, Such explosives are normally meant for terrorist activities which are carried by the sleeper cells of the outfits. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has joined the investigation. The agencies are calibrating the circumstances to find out where they were being taken to...Around five terrorist sleeper cells have been busted and more than 10 terrorists arrested from different parts of the state since 2000. The sleeper cells are connected with their handlers who guide them in carrying put acts of terror. All such sleeper cells were destroyed after they were busted . Tags
8243	2015	5	pakistan	The slain al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden had ‘advance’ knowledge of the 2008 Mumbai terror (also known as 26 11) attacks and he wanted to establish an al Qaeda state in parts of Pakistan after the breakout of a possible war between India and Pakistan, reported The News on May 19, quoting a new book authored by a Pakistani journalist. The book titled The Secrets of Pakistan’s war on Al Qaeda by Geo News senior correspondent Azaz Syed mentions a secret meeting between Bin Laden and Ilyas Kashmiri, an al Qaeda militant who had contacts in Lashkar e Toiba (LeT). The author claims that the meeting held in Haripur District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2006 2007, discussed the possibility of a war between two South Asian nuclear armed neighbours as a result of an imminent attack on Indian soil. “Osama was thrilled to know about LeT’s plan to attack the Indian city of Mumbai. For long he had desired to set up his own state. A war between India and Pakistan would have materialized his dreams,” says the book. “The state Osama envisaged stood on a broken Pakistan, comprising Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), KP, Islamabad and some parts of Punjab. He even drew its map, which the author has seen,” Azaz wrote.

36887	2013	5	srilanka	The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), a coalition party of ruling United People s Freedom Alliance (UPFA), said it will take measures to mobilize the public to urge the government to abolish the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, Colombo Page reported on May 24. JHU parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Ratana Thero said the public must be mobilized to urge the government to change its stance on the 13th Amendment. Ven. Ratana Thero observed that the JHU s proposed motion to amend the Constitution to abolish the provincial council system in the country is to be presented to parliament next week. JHU on May 22 revealed party s proposed 19th Amendment to the Constitution primarily to repeal the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, which paved way for the power devolving Provincial Council system in the island. Thero s call to abolish the 13th Amendment came in response to the May 23 statement by Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa that the Government would not abolish the 13th Amendment. Yapa had said the government has no intention whatsoever to repeal the 13th Amendment or introduce amendments to the Constitution to remove police and land powers to the provinces or postpone the Northern Provincial Council polls. Minister Yapa said if the government introduces the Constitution or amendments to the Constitution it would be through a consensus by all stakeholders. The government would resort to a power devolution process or introduce constitutional changes only through an extensive political interaction with all political parties and other stakeholders and that is why the government took measures to constitute a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to discuss all these issues related to power devolution, police and land powers to PCs and security issues of the provinces, the Minister said.

35835	2013	12	pakistan	The seat left empty by the murder of the Peoples Amn Committee (PAC) leader, Zafar Baloch, will not be vacant for long as the ‘elders’, fearing that the group might meet the same fate as its late leader, have announced that Rauf Baloch will take over the rein, reported The Express Tribune on December 20 (today). Known as the political face of PAC, Zafar was shot dead in September 2013 in Lyari Town by unidentified assailants. Like Zafar, Rauf has also been a political activist since his youth. But although he has been throned, it has yet to be decided in what capacity he can exercise his powers. The elders and other party members are aware that Rauf has a dominant personality and while Zafar always stood by Uzair, Rauf is believed to be someone who would think for himself rather than following orders. Other names which were considered to replace Zafar included Habib Jan, Malik Fayyaz, Shahjahan Baloch, Mama Younus Baloch and Shahid Rehman. But the two leading contenders, Habib Jan and Shahjahan, were not a viable choice as the former is abroad and the latter is in jail. “There is a need to replace the empty post with a strong personality which is why Rauf has been chosen but we are still trying to decide what powers to give him,” a source privy to the matter said. While rearranging their internal set up, PAC and its allies are also considering cutting off their old ties with the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP).” “Our men are being killed or are arrested almost daily but the PPP leaders do not even bother issuing a statement to express their sympathy with us,” said a source in PAC. “We are not bound to anyone. We have a right to join any other party and we can.”

6885	2015	12	india	A joint team of Delhi and Bhubaneswar Police arrested a 37 year old man from Cuttack on December 16, for his alleged link with al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), reports The Times of India. The accused was identified as Abdul Rehman, a resident of Jagatpur area in Cuttack. The joint team arrested him from his house. The Delhi police will take him on transit remand, said Commissioner of Police R P Sharma. Prima facie, Delhi police came to know about his link with AQIS. He is also having link with radical groups in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Dubai. He was wanted by the special cell of Delhi police since his provocative speeches in Ranchi a few months back, Sharma stated. Police suspected that Rehman was actively involved in recruiting and training young cadres in guise of running a Madrasa (Islamic Seminary) in Tangi, nearly 30 kilometer from Cuttack. Police said Rehman s operations were confined to Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka (Bangalore) where he organized several community meetings and delivered inflammatory speeches. He was a facilitator of AQIS. So far, we have no information about his operations in Odisha. Still, we have kept a surveillance on his family, friends, relatives and Madrasa, Sharma said.

He was allegedly present at the grand shura of al Qaeda in the Afghanisatan Pakistan region when the terror group s Indian subcontinent wing was established. Asif returned to India to develop and establish the terror groups. On the other hand Rehman is suspected to have links in Saudi Arabia, Dubai, United Kingdom and Pakistan. His brother was arrested in the 2001 American consulate attack in Kolkata. Asif s interrogation helped investigators to establish the identity of Mulana Asim Umar, the self proclaimed amir (chief) of AQIS. Umar emigrated from India in 1995 and joined terror group Harkat ul Mujahideen. His interrogation also revealed that he was motivated to join the group through social media. A few other youngsters from his village had fled to Pakistan and joined terror outfits. In 2012 he got in touch with Umar who convinced him to come to Pakistan. Asif got two more men with him and the finance was arranged by Umar. They applied for visa to do ziyarat at Ayatollah Khomaini s graveyard in Iran. On June 23, 2013 they went from New Delhi to Tehran and through contacts they travelled to the interiors of Iran, Zahedan and then to Sarwan on Iran Pakistan border.

27772	2013	6	india	Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) wrote to the Nagaland Chief Secretary to stop Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland Isac Muivah (NSCN IM) from levying ‘tax’ on common people, saying that such action by the Naga insurgent group is leading to price rise of commodities and this cannot be allowed to continue, reports Sangai Express. In the letter, the MHA stated that there has been a serious situation following NSCN IM’s declaration that every Naga as well as others residing in ‘Nagalim’ shall ‘pay tax’. MHA Director (North East ), J P N Singh, in his letter, said NSCN IM has been arrogating itself the responsibility of finding a political solution on behalf of Nagas in general of which it clearly is not the sole representative. The outfit is not only not observing the ceasefire ground rules, but also violating all the existing laws rules and regulations, he said. Singh further said, “You may kindly agree that this is a situation in which the mere argument of having ceasefire with the government of India is no excuse to go on a rampage and destroy the public confidence in the state. It is high time that the state takes its responsibility seriously and starts looking after the interest of its subjects. Unbearable pressure of rising prices cannot be allowed to continue adding to the miseries of the people. You are requested to initiate measures to stop what is going on and also ensure security of the office bearers of ACAUT (Action Committee against Unabated Taxation).” The NSCN IM has justified the system of ‘taxation’ and asserted that it was the only outfit mandated by the Nagas for holding political talks with the Government of India for resolving the Naga political issue.

He added that the amendment that repeals the clause that empowers the President to merge two provinces will be brought as an urgent bill in Parliament soon.

52280	2012	1	srilanka	Mass Media and Information Minister Keheliya Rambukwella on January 18 said that Government can overcome political extremism, reports Daily Excelsior. Although a handful of bankrupt political extremists are trying to create a crisis in the country, the government has the strength to thwart such attempts and bring them under control within the next few days,” he stated. The Minister said that cropping up of minor problems is a natural feature when certain Government sectors tried to effect changes essential for the country s forward march. A certain extremist group was trying to exaggerate them as national problems to create a temporary uprising in the country putting the blame on the Government for it. Minister Rambukwella noted that certain trade unions as well as extremist groups failed to unite and act in a responsible manner beneficial to the country s progress as regards the problems in universities, GCE Advanced Level results, and issues relating to the use of crates in vegetable transport, private sector pensions and other issues. There is no big challenge that is insurmountable for the Government which had the strength to solve the terrorist problem and usher in peace for the countrymen. The Minister who described the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) which operated a propaganda and fund raising network in nearly 230 countries as one of the richest terrorist organizations found in the world, said that even though the Government was able to defeat LTTE terrorists initially the Eelam dream had not been erased from the minds of Tamils living abroad and various local and foreign organizations due to the Tamil homeland concept propounded by the LTTE. Since their motives cropped up under different faces, the Government will understand the situation and provide the necessary solutions for that problem too.

2327	2015	3	india	Khaplang faction of NSCN (NSCN K) is heading for another split as SS Khaplang expelled Wangtin Naga, supervisor of the outfit’s Cease Fire Monitoring Supervisory Board (CFSB) on March 28. Wangtin participated in the Cease Fire meeting with the Government of India (GoI) representatives in Dimapur, reports The Assam Tribune. In a statement NSCN K stated that ‘chairman and president’ of NSCN K has expelled ‘kilonser’ (minister) Wangtin Naga and ‘kilonser’ Tikhak from both the ‘party’ and the ‘government’. The Telegraph further adds that sources state that the expelled leaders accused of toeing the Indian government s line, are likely to enter into a ceasefire agreement with GoI under a different name shortly. The outfit may represent eastern Nagaland . Also GoI will now talk only to rebels who are on the Indian side. The new faction will ostensibly be led by Wangtin Naga. GoI also intends to seal the border with Myanmar to prevent hit and run attacks by NSCN K. NSCN K’s Khaplang s rival factions may help Security Forces (SFs) in this and this may have a larger implication as there are routes in Nagaland dominated by NSCN K which were used by other groups for transit such as Independent faction of United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA I), IK Songbijit faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NDFB IKS) and valley based groups of Manipur. Khaplang has sheltered all these groups in Myanmar where he holds sway over a huge territory where Yangon hardly has any administration.

The proposal has envisioned the PLA leadership of the force that will be formed by incorporating 10,000 former fighters and the same number of personnel combinedly from the existing three forces— Nepal Army, Nepal Police and Armed Police Force. For rehabilitation, the proposal has talked about providing a fat purse to the combatants if they choose not to be the part of army integration but prefer joining politics or social sector NR 7 lakh up to the post of ‘platoon commander’ and NR10 lakh above it under the scheme of “golden handshake.” The handicapped and injured PLA men will also be entitled to the scheme. The government is yet to decide on the proposal, while the Nepali Congress has snubbed it saying the maximum number of PLA combatants should be 5,000.

49608	2012	9	pakistan	Pakistan Tehrik i Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan announced on September 4 that he would lead a ‘peace march’ from Islamabad to South Waziristan on October 6 to express solidarity with the people of the tribal area and to protest against US drone attacks, reports Dawn. Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, he claimed that about 100,000 people, including a sister in law of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of the families of American soldiers who had died during the so called war on terror, would take part in the march. Accompanied by PTI president Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, Vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi and other leaders, Khan said the march would reach South Waziristan on October 7 after an overnight stay in Dera Ismail Khan. It has taken almost two months for the PTI to finalise the date for the march which Khan had announced in July. Last month, national and international media carried an Associated Press interview with a spokesman for the banned Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Ehsanullah Ehsan, who threatened that the Taliban would kill Imran Khan if he ventured into their stronghold in South Waziristan. The following day the TTP spokesman denied having threatened to kill the PTI chief. He said in an email that the stance would be announced after the “Shura of TTP…decide what to do a week before his confirmed arrival”. On the other hand, Khan had declared that his party would go ahead with its plan despite the threat. He said Pakistan had been fighting America’s so called war against terror for eight years which had only resulted in an increase in extremism in the country. “We have lost 40,000 people and faced a loss of $70 billion during last eight years but still the government is not willing to quit the American war,” he said, adding that an operation in North Waziristan would bring more disasters.

Sitting in a camp in front of the Karachi Press Club (KPC) in Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh, since January 1, 2012 to protest against the “disappearances” of Baloch people, Qadeer said about 250,000 people from Marri and Dera Bugti areas had migrated to other provinces and even to Afghanistan since their lives were in danger. The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons has so far organised three protest camps outside the KPC, two in Islamabad and several in Quetta. “The precarious situation in Balochistan can be gauged from the fact that along with adults, 169 children are also missing,” Qadeer said. Speaking at a News Conference on International Human Rights Day at the KPC, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) Chairperson Zohra Yusuf had said the establishment saw the problem of Balochistan as a “security issue” but it would not be fair to say it wanted to get rid of Balochistan.

Yusuf said Baloch nationalists claimed that 5,000 7,000 people were “missing” in Balochistan, but HRCP figures were more conservative. “It is a matter of grave alarm that 107 new cases of enforced disappearance have been reported in Balochistan in 2011, and the ‘missing persons’ are increasingly turning up dead,” she added.

61133	2011	6	pakistan	Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai on June 12 said that the Indian presence in his country cannot be in any way used against Pakistan, which should be happy that Afghanistan is being tremendously helped by another neighbour, reports Indian Express. The Indian presence in Afghanistan... cannot be in any manner used against Pakistan, Karzai said in an interview to state run PTV. India, being an old friend of Afghanistan, was helping it tremendously and providing financial assistance, he said. Pakistan should feel happy that Afghanistan is being helped by another neighbour, Karzai said. At the same time, he pointed out that Pakistan is a conjoined twin and brother of Afghanistan. Karzai lauded the role of the Pakistani leadership and people in enhanced cooperation with Afghanistan to achieve peace and stability in the region. In addition, President Hamid Karzai’s top officials said after the visit to Islamabad that Pakistan is more willing than before to play a role in Afghanistan’s tentative peace process with the Taliban and has agreed to target the hideouts of Taliban fighters and other insurgents who attack Afghanistan and refuse to take part in faltering peace talks. Karzai, who met Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, called on the Pakistani Government to help Taliban militants take part in any peace negotiations, said Muhammad Masoom Stanikzai, secretary of a peace council set up by Karzai. “During the talks, the message of the Afghanistan Government was very clear,” he said. “The message was that those (rebels) who want to join the peace process and reconcile should be facilitated and the means should be prepared for them in order to enable them to join the negotiations,” he added. But those who do not want to join the reconciliation process “must be dropped... No room should be left (for them to) arrange and organise and encourage people to fight and continue the war.” In response, Pakistan was “much more welcoming than at any other time”, said Karzai’s spokesman Waheed Omer.
