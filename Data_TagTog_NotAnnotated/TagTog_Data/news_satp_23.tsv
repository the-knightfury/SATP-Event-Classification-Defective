60553	2011	4	pakistan	At least one Guantánamo Bay detainee discovered to be involved in a plot to attack the US Consulate in Peshawar and believed to have carried out a string of bombings in Pakistan in 2002, was also on the payroll for British and Canadian intelligence services, according to secret files on detainees at the Guantánamo Bay prison camp, The express Tribune quoting WikiLeaks reported on April 27. Algerian detainee Adil Hadi al Jazairi bin Hamili, linked with the Algerian Armed Islamic Group and the Hezb e Islami Gulbuddin, confessed that he had worked for the Taliban’s foreign ministry and intelligence services as well. Hamili was captured in a raid in Peshawar in 2003. According to Pakistan’s Intelligence Bureau, Hamili was an Algerian terrorist, hired assassin, kidnapper, and member of Osama bin Laden’s “umbrella organisation.” However, the Central Intelligence Agency found that not only was Hamili a source for the British and Canadian intelligence services who had withheld information from the two, but he was also running a terrorist cell. According to US assessment, Hamili was actually Abu Adil, who Khalid Shaikh Mohammad had confessed to meeting in early 2002. Mohammad had given PKR 300,000 to support Abu Adil’s cell in Punjab and an assassination plot against the then President General Pervez Musharraf. According to Mohammad, Abu Adil was responsible for attacks on two churches in Islamabad and Sialkot, and possibly involved in the May 2002 attack on Karachi’s Sheraton Hotel in which 11 French engineers and three Pakistanis were killed. Hamili was recruited by foreign intelligence “because of his connections to members of various al Qaeda linked terrorist groups that operated in Afghanistan and Pakistan.” Hamili was not the only spy in custody. Iraqi detainee Bisher al Rawi also said he had links with MI5 and was providing information to the agency on Abu Qatada, the ‘spiritual leader of the Armed Islamic Group’. The document states that the intelligence service owned up to this. “When visiting Guantánamo Bay, a member of an allied intelligence service admitted a relationship with the detainee.”

10071	2015	8	nepal	The dispute over the delineation and number of federal states has deepened with the signatories to the 16 point agreement pitching new proposals and stances, reports Ekantipur.com on August 7. With the delay in building consensus, chances of promulgating the new constitution by August 16 are fading. In a shift from the parties’ official positions, discussions are focused on the stances of top leaders of the major parties and the growing pressure from cross party Constituent Assembly (CA) members not to split particular Districts and regions while carving out the federal structure. According to leaders, the unstructured dialogue has robbed the marathon meeting of positive outcomes. The demarcation dispute surrounds Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari, Saptari, Kanchanpur and Kailali Districts. Senior leader of Nepali Congress (NC) Sher Bahadur Deuba and Communist Party of Nepal Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN UML) leader Bhim Rawal are adamant that the nine Districts of the Far West should remain undivided and Kailali should not be split. Deuba and Rawal maintain that federalism would be ineffective in case Kailali is split. Factions within the NC, the CPN UML and the Unified Communist Party of Nepal Maoist (UCPN M) are, however, for reaching a deal even by splitting the Districts. Disputes over secularism, forms of government and provisions regarding citizenship, among others, have yet to be resolved. As the parties failed to sort the contention, a new constitution by August 16, as agreed informally among the parties, is unlikely. Constitution Drafting Committee (CDC) Chairman Krishna Prasad Sitaula has said a week is required to prepare the final constitution draft after the Constitutional Political Dialogue and Consensus Committee (CPDCC) completes its work.

14578	2014	6	india	The intelligence bureau (IB) warned Delhi Police about a possible terror strike at north Delhi’s busy Chandni Chowk market in the run up to Independence Day (August 15), reports Hindustan Times on June 13. Previous IB generated terror forewarnings either mentioned south Delhi markets such as Greater Kailash M block and Connaught Place, where multiple bombings have occurred in the past as possible targets, or were general advisories asking the Police to step up security across popular market places in the Capital. This time, however, the input is unambiguous and, according to sources in the IB, goes to the extent of stating that ‘militant Islamist cadre’ were chalking out a plan to ‘replicate’ attacks like the multiple bombings of February 2013 at Dilsukhnagar in Hyderabad, in addition to a similar attack at Mumbai’s Zaveri Bazaar during serial blasts by the Indian Mujahideen (IM) in 2011.

62409	2011	9	pakistan	The US officials knew for a very long time that Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) had created various terrorist groups, including those based out from Nepal, to carry out attacks in India, according to the latest US cables released by Wikileaks, according to Indian Express. The US cables clearly show that Americans also knew that Tiger Memon, the prime accused in 1993 Mumbai blast case and an aide of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, had tied up with the ISI. One of such organisations created by ISI in Pakistan was Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front (JKIF), with its main base in Kathmandu, Nepal. To dispatch men and material and to execute explosions in India, Kathmandu was invariably made the nodal point and JKIF exploited the vulnerable Kathmandu based Kashmiri businessmen for such activities since they had a ready made and clean past. JKIF kingpin Javed Krawah himself used to run a carpet business in Kathmandu, said the US cable signed off by the then US Ambassador to India, Frank Wisner. The JKIF, says the cable dated July 8, 1997, was controlled from Pakistan by ISI and Memon. Their contact in Pakistan occupied Kashmir was Bilal Beg, who was running an indoctrination camp near Muzaffarabad, funded extensively by the ISI to carry out terrorist acts in India. One Colonel Farooq of Pakistan ISI tasked Bilal Beg and Tiger Memon to utilize Kathmandu based activists Lateef and Javed Krawah to set off blasts in Delhi before the Lok Sabha elections, it said. In May 21, 1996 this JKIF team set off a very high intensity explosion at Lajpat Nagar, in which 13 persons were killed and 40 injured. The RDX used in this blast was brought from Kathmandu, the cable said. The subsequent explosion in a Rajasthan roadways bus near Dausa on May 22, 1996 was also engineered by the JKIF. Another JKIF team under the leadership of Abdul Gani, AKA Assadullah, was sent to execute a bomb blast in Ahmedabad, it said. The JKIF again planned a chain of explosions in Delhi before Republic Day 1997 at the behest of ISI and Tiger Memon, the cable said. Since its inception, the JKIF had been under considerable pressure from its Pakistan based leadership to carry out bomb blasts outside Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in Delhi, the cable said.

3238	2015	5	india	As Myanmar Government is yet to take effective steps to drive out the militants taking shelter in that country, the Central Government has decided to take strong steps to squeeze the fund flow to the camps of the ultras to make life miserable for them, reports Nagaland Post on May 18. Almost all the active militant groups of the Northeast have strong bases in Myanmar and despite repeated assurances the Government of that country is yet to take strong action against them. Highly placed security sources informed that the ultras would be crippled if the flow of funds can be squeezed and the police and security forces have managed to do that to a large extent. The worst hit is the IK Songbijit faction of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB IKS), while the other militant groups have also been affected as most people are not ready to pay the demanded amounts. Sources pointed out that the main source of income of the NDFB IKS was abductions and extortions, but in the last four months, the outfit failed to abduct any person. The security agencies recently received an input that the debt burden of the NDFB IKS has gone up to INR 6 million and the leaders of the outfit staying in Myanmar called up the ‘commander in chief’ G Bidai to urgently send money. But Bidai himself is on the run and is not in a position to launch any extortion drive. During the ongoing operations, police and security forces managed to arrest 148 militants belonging to the outfit along with more than 160 linkmen and couriers. The Independent faction of United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA I), led by Paresh Baruah, is still getting money in trickles but most people are not ready to pay the demanded amount as was the case in the past.

Unilateral abrogation of the cease fire agreement on March 27 with Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland Khaplang (NSCN K) would also affect the movement of the militants from Myanmar to the northeast.

2152	2015	3	india	Fearing civilian casualties, the anti Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist) squad stopped short of opening fire at a Maoist gang at Mukkanampotti tribal colony at Nilambur in Malapuram District last week, reports The New Indian Express on March 19. The Police inaction had invited criticism from various corners and it is their first clarification on the incident, though it is unofficial. The Police spotted a seven member CPI Maoist gang in the tribal colony when the extremists were just a few metres away. It was for the first time that the Police Force in the District was coming that close to nabbing the extremist group members. “However, the police were not in a position to attack the gang. They were atop a hilly terrain and the Police were on the down side. Five of the seven people were inside the house of Chathan, a resident of the colony, having food. The others were watching the surroundings. If we had opened fire at that moment, they would have used the tribal family as cover to escape bullets. The lives of both the policemen and the civilians were at risk,” sources in the force said seeking anonymity. The police action invited criticism from various quarters. But they believe what they did was right. “There were three women in the house. There would have been a huge public uproar had any civilian been injured in the attack on Maoists.” Meanwhile, on the basis of intelligence tip that Maoists may target Wayanad District Collectorate in the hope that it could give them better public attention, the government has decided on March 12 to bring the collectorate building and surrounding areas under electronic surveillance system, reports The Times of India.

1727	2015	2	india	The Delhi High Court has sought the response of the Narendra Modi Government over a security breach in the printing of currency at a mint in Hoshangabad District in Madhya Pradesh, reports India Today on February 23. Acting on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed earlier this month, the court has asked how lapses led to the printing of bank notes with threads having Arabic inscriptions on them in 2012.

31706	2013	1	pakistan	The Government’s persistent failure to protect the minority Shia community from sectarian attacks by Sunni militant groups, is reprehensible and amounts to complicity in the slaughter of Pakistani citizens, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on January 10, reports The Express Tribune. “The government should immediately hold accountable those responsible for ordering and participating in deadly attacks targeting the Shia across Pakistan and particularly the Hazara Shia in Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province. 2012 was the bloodiest year for Pakistan’s Shia community in living memory and if this latest attack January 10 attacks is any indication, 2013 has started on an even more dismal note,” said Ali Dayan Hasan, Pakistan director at HRW. “As Shia community members continue to be slaughtered in cold blood, the callousness and indifference of authorities offers a damning indictment of the state, its military and security agencies,” he added.

So, till our troops are deployed there, we understand we can face this challenge.” The GOC said that so far there has been zero infiltration in Kashmir this year due to good intelligence network. “I think this is the first time that we have been able to achieve zero infiltration so far particularly in this period when the snow melts and it takes a while for the anti infiltration obstacle system, the fence to come up, so that it goes entirely to the credit of the soldiers who are operating on the ground and of course supporting them is a good intelligence network and improved surveillance grid and some very depth changes in depositions that have been done to be sure we were able to pre empt all these attempts to infiltrate”, he added.

51024	2012	11	pakistan	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 28 told the Lahore High Court (LHC) that the main focus of United States (US) drone attacks was on targeting terrorists in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), however, these strikes were in violation of country’s sovereignty, reports Dawn. In a written reply submitted in connection with a petition filed by Jama’at ud Dawa (JuD) Chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed against US drones attacks on Pakistani soil to Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, the Ministry said the Pakistan Government had been consistent in registering its strong protest with the US on collateral damage and violation of sovereignty. It said the quarters concerned and the Parliament had also been denouncing these attacks which were also conveyed to the US Government. In his petition the JuD chief had submitted that the Federal Government be directed to make public information about all matters of public importance, especially the secret ‘deals’ with US in implementation of article 19 A of the Constitution which entitles every citizen of Pakistan to have access to all information. The Ministry further stated that the US started to opt for drone attacks in tribal areas of Pakistan essentially from 2008 onwards. However, the frequency of the attacks increased in 2009 as 37 strikes were made in that year and 115 in 2010 when the US administration decided to dismantle safe havens of terrorists on the border areas, it said and added that so far more than 200 drone strikes had taken place. The Ministry also clarified that it had neither any record nor was privy to any agreement with the US Government for carrying out drone attacks. It said the Pakistan Government would continue to underscore with the US side about the futility of these attacks that were enhancing anti Americanism and affecting the bilateral relations. At the end of the reply, the Ministry requested the court to dismiss the petition filed by JuD being not maintainable. It said the petitioner approached the LHC under article 199 of the Constitution which allowed only an aggrieved person to file a petition. The Public Interest Litigation fell within the purview of article 184(3) of the Constitution which was the jurisdiction of Supreme Court.

49346	2012	8	pakistan	In a fresh damning disclosure, a new book has claimed that Abbottabad house where al Qaeda ‘chief’ lived was carved out from Pakistan Military Academy compound and its Army chief may have been briefed beforehand on the kill Osama mission , reports Indian Express. Leading from Behind The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him , penned by eminent American journalist Richard Miniter, which has hit the stands, claims that land of the Abbottabad compound, where Osama bin Laden lived with his family, was carved out from the elite military academy compound. The book also claims that Army Chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani may have been briefed by the US on its operation to kill bin Laden, some five months in advance. The Book, further, claims that an officer of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) helped the CIA track down Osama Bin Laden. “In a never before reported account, Pakistan was more involved in the Bin Laden operation than Obama’s team admitted. When the CIA revealed that an ISI colonel had contacted the CIA in Islamabad and offered information about Bin Laden, a debate followed,” said the book. “Was this a secret sign that the head of the ISI himself was pointing out Bin Laden’s hiding place or was the colonel actually the patriot who hated extremism that he claimed to be Whatever the motivation, the CIA found Bin Laden’s hiding place within a month of the colonel’s visit,” the book claims. In addition, the book said that the US President Barack Obama put off three times operations to kill Osama bin Laden before finally going ahead with the mission at the insistence of secretary of state Hillary Clinton. The president feared that the daring navy Seals operation might go tragically wrong and he would be blamed for it, the Mail Online reported. The book claims the White House s narrative of Obama as a decisive leader who sanctioned Osama s killing was a myth . At the start of his Presidency, Miniter writes, Obama was studiously undecided about whether to kill Osama. He left critical decisions to the then CIA chief Leon Panetta, then secretary of defence Robert Gates and secretary of state Hillary Clinton.

5747	2015	10	india	Indian agencies seem to discount the possibility of Islamic State s (IS) involvement in the recent killings of an Italian and a Japanese national in Bangladesh, The Times of India reports on October 6. They have instead sought to blame Jamaat e Islami (JeI) rebels and see the murderous attacks as a ploy to draw attention of the Western nations to targeting of their top leaders for 1971 war crimes without proper trial as required by an international war tribunal . The hanging of some top Jamaat e Islami (JeI) leaders may be due in the near future one of the most prominent leaders on the death row is Motiur Rahman Nizami, whose appeal is now being heard by the Supreme Court, a senior officer of the Indian establishment pointed out. The attacks on foreigners seem to aimed at drawing the immediate attention of the West. Also, given that IS generates the widest interest across the globe, JeI may be projecting attacks by extremists linked to it as those executed by IS. This attracts immediate condemnation by the western world and may further JeI s intention to project the Hasina government as ineffective in managing the security situation, said the officer. Agencies feel the Bangladesh killings do not bear the IS hallmark. Beheading victims and videographing the brutal murders is a known modus operandi of IS and the killings in Bangladesh were both shooting incidents. Though Bangladesh has rounded up some suspects, no evidence of their links with IS has been found so far. Those detained may not be the real perpetrators, but investigations are on to identify them...but until now, there is nothing beyond a claim to establish any IS link, said an official following the events in Bangladesh.
