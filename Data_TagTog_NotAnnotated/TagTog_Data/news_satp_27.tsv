The camp was headed by SIMI chief Safdar Nagori who swore revenge against India. These camps ensured the regrouping of various youth who went on to form the IM. Tunda during his interrogation also said about the camp at Wagamon. He had told the Police that several such camps were held in various parts of Kerala which had helped the groups flourish. These camps not only helped to change the mindset but also increased the recruitments, the Police had also found while questioning Tunda.

The Home and the Finance Ministries prepared the draft proposal aimed at bringing changes to the Anti Terrorism Act, 2009.

35541	2013	11	pakistan	Lawyers for seven Pakistanis accused of involvement in the Mumbai 2008 attacks (also known as 26 11) on November 25 said the case against them “lacks evidence”, reports Daily Times. Pakistan charged seven men in 2009 over the attacks, but has insisted it needs to gather more evidence in India before proceeding further, infuriating New Delhi. Rizwan Abbasi, a lawyer for the accused said the Indians only had themselves to blame for the slow progress. “This case has many legal flaws and lacks evidence. It is being delayed in Pakistan because India has failed to provide required evidence against the accused,” he said in a news conference. The only gunman to survive the siege, Ajmal Kasab, was tried in Mumbai and hanged on November 21, 2012 for waging war against India, murder and terrorist attacks. “By hanging Kasab, India destroyed the only living evidence of these attacks and created problems for investigations in Pakistan,” Abbasi said. New Delhi has branded Pakistan’s attempts at prosecuting the men a “facade” and has insisted it has already handed over enough evidence to convict the accused. Abbasi claimed the dossiers handed over by India contained only “information and no solid evidence”. “There was also no proof that the attackers had any link with my clients because the phone numbers Indian authorities said were used for the contacts were not of Pakistani companies,” he added.

The NIA has filed a charge sheet saying that a key aide of Geelani had supplied INR 45.7 million of slush funds from the ISI in Pakistan to the separatists in J K for secessionist and terror activities. Sources in the Home Ministry say that though NIA has not named Geelani as an accused in their charge sheet, a further probe is on into his role.

10795	2015	8	srilanka	The Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera in a statement said it is clear that from the statements being made by Mahinda Rajapaksa, that the former president has amnesia since he has forgotten the past and asked the former leader to come up with a more intelligent slogan than racism and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to address the people, reports Colombo Page on August 5. The Minister said the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has taken the racism as his main slogan for each and every election held after 2005 but the people rejected this main theme on the 8th of January this year. Now he has forgotten that and is continuing to follow the same theme even during this election campaign, Perera pointed out. According to Rajapaksa if the LTTE was eliminated in 2009, Deputy Minister Ajith Perera questioned why he talks about LTTE raising its head again. He said the thirty year long war is like the beggar s wound to Rajapaksa. Perera said the most important fact that Rajapaksa has forgotten is the friendship he had with the LTTE. Rajapaksa had a very friendly relationship with LTTE, the Deputy Minister said. He reminded that Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman who is allegedly responsible for killing 600 Police officers and the murder of Bhikkus (Buddhist monk) at Aranthalawa was appointed as a Vice President of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) by Mahinda Rajapaksa. Perera also reminded that it was Mahinda Rajapaksa who directly gave Velupillai Prabhakaran a grant of LKR 800 million through Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) as a result of which Mahinda Rajapaksa with Prabhakaran s blessings won the Presidential election in 2005. If not for this gesture on the part of Prabhakaran, Mahinda Rajapaksa would have not become the President of this country, Perera said.

5361	2015	9	india	According to highly placed security sources, the tough stand adopted by the Government of India (GoI) against the militants involved in December 23, 2014 massacre has brought down the level of violence in Assam, reports The Assam Tribune on September 11. Though initially, the operation was aimed against the IK Songbijit faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB IKS), which was involved in the massacre, the operations seriously affected the other militant groups active in the State. In the past, such operations launched after killings of innocents were not sustained for a long time, but because of the tough stand of the GoI, the operations have been sustained and the force level on the ground has also not been reduced. Sources said that in the operations against NDFB IKS, so far, around 30 hardcore militants have been killed, while more than 190 have been arrested. More than 250 sympathisers and overground workers of the outfit have also been arrested. Report said that till May 2015, senior NDFB IKS leader G Bidai, who allegedly masterminded the December 23 attack, was moving around with around 40 cadres and the strength of his group has dwindled to less than 10 now. They very often get into the Manas National Park to avoid arrest by the Security Forces (SFs). Small groups of NDFB IKS men are also located in Gossaigaon, Saralpara, Udalguri, Sonitpur, etc., but they are not in a position to come out of the jungles. Abduction for ransom was the main source of income of the NDFB IKS, but the outfit could not abduct anyone since the operation was launched against the outfit last year. Sources further add that under serious pressure, NDFB IKS leader G Bidai has sent feelers to the Government through a few non government organisations (NGOs) expressing his desire to go for a ceasefire. But the Government is not willing to take the offer. “The Government’s stand on the issue is very clear. If Bidai and any other member of the outfit wants to surrender, they will be arrested and they will have to face the law. There will be no ceasefire with the outfit,” sources added.

Jama’at Ahmadiyya Pakistan spokesperson Saleem ud Din stated Mabroor Ahmad was assassinated in a religiously motivated attack on the night of July 11 in Nawabshah District of Sindh province, adding, that such violence results from the continuing hatred that is being spread throughout Pakistan against Jama’at Ahmadiyya. “I call upon the Government to dispense swift justice against the perpetrators of this crime,” Saleem said, adding, “Malik Mabroor Ahmad had survived another bid on his life in 2008 but no action was taken by the local authorities to protect him from the extremists.” He added that District Chief of Jama’at Ahmadiyya Nawabshah, Muhammad Yousaf was assassinated in 2008 while a well known Ahmedi doctor Abdul Manan Siddique also fell prey to the target killers in Mirpurkhas District.

3714	2015	6	india	It has been estimated that People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Manipur Naga Revolutionary Front (MNRF) sustained 68 casualties during the cross Border raid into Myanmar on June 9, reports The Times of India on June 12. It is also estimated that Khaplang faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN K) suffered 15 casualties as they vacated a camp across Nagaland Myanmar border soon after the Army Special Forces struck. There is no official confirmation yet on the casualties suffered by and other insurgent outfits in the raid, intelligence reports with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) indicate that at least 19 insurgents killed in the operation were buried on June 11, with a burial in the presence of a Buddhist religious leader. A Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) source stated that information regarding the burial of insurgents bodies in the presence of a Buddhist religious leader came from intelligence assets both on Indian and Myanmar side of the border, reports The Times of India. The Ministry has also learnt from multiple sources, including those based in villages dotting the Myanmar Manipur border and trusted aides in touch with Myanmar authorities that around 49 bodies were removed from the site where the camps stood after the Army raid. In addition, as many as 60 injured militants were shifted out in 12 13 vehicles to safer locations in Kalemyo in Sagaing District, Mandalay in Mandalay District and beyond. UMHA officials insist their casualty estimates are credible since they are based on ground reports collated after speaking to local villagers and sources in touch with the Myanmar army and intelligence agencies. The officials claimed that the figures are more or less corroborated by ground reports collected by Military Intelligence, reports The Times of India on June 12. Initial reports coming in a day after the raids had indicated that 30 insurgents were killed and six injured. This figure was further revised to 38 killed and 12 injured later. However, fresh intelligence inputs on June 12 pointed to a much higher casualty figure at 68 killed in camps across Manipur and 15 across Nagaland, besides 60 injured. In related news, June 9 cross border strikes by the Army on insurgents inside Myanmar may have had less impact on their military capacity than early assessments had indicated, reports The Indian Express on June 11. According to assessments being conducted by the Army with Intelligence services, just seven bodies have been recovered so far and less than a dozen insurgents were injured. A senior Military Intelligence official stated that, the targets, one camp in Onzia and two adjacent camps in Ponyo, did not hit perpetrators of the June 4 ambush. The Special Forces went almost 11 km inside Myanmar, 5 km farther than what had been initially planned. One camp destroyed in Ponyo was being led by Niki Sumi, ‘lieutenant general’ of NSCN K. But Sumi and an estimated 40 militants of the group are said to have left the camp before the strike. Two separate military officials said the more lethal strike targeted the Onzia camp unconnected to NSCN K or KYKL. Indian intelligence had reported since at least 2010 the Onzia camp used to house the so called 253 Mobile Battalion of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The camp, Manipur Police sources said, operated mainly to extort funds from traffickers and traders. An Army spokesperson said that the Army was aware the camp did not house NSCN K personnel but added that the target was an umbrella of organisations rather than a specific group. The second Army attack targeted two adjacent NSCN K facilities at Ponyo, near the Myanmar town of Lahe, just across the border from the Mon District in Nagaland. According to Nagaland Police officials it is a relatively minor facility, served as launch pad for NSCN K movement into Nagaland from its rear bases around Taga, in Myanmar’s Sagaing District. The Telegraph further adds on July 12 that according to information reaching the Government, Khaplang ‘commands’ 400 armed militants.

Sources said the militants, or former militants, were unable to take these routes due to presence of Pakistani Army and Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) on these routes.The Indian Intelligence agencies were also worried that some of the militants, though not active now, could be used by the militants present in the State to revive the dying militancy. Moreover, most of the militants were returning with Pakistani wives, who could also pose a security risk at some stage.

According to Union Home Ministry sources, a draft proposal has been prepared and the same has been placed before the Chief Minister of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister. The final approval or rather the stamp of agreement by the Chief Ministers of the three States will be the key to the solution being sought, said the sources.

Thanks notably to a flood of recruits flowing to join al Qaeda linked forces fighting in Syria’s civil war, the group is back on its feet, and securing territory from which it could once more threaten Europe and the United States. Bin Laden’s former lieutenants in al Qaeda’s historic leadership have been killed by US Special Forces or in drone strikes, or else are isolated and on the run in the tribal badlands on the Afghan Pakistan border. But armed groups in Syria, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and West Africa have flocked to his banner and al Qaeda is rebuilding its influence and recruiting fighters across the region. “Their leadership has been hit very hard, but this brand is still growing. And it’s growing from an increased number of safe havens,” said retired US Marine Corps General James Mattis, adding, “Al Qaeda is resilient, they adapted. We have to think strategically before we act, not only act tactically.”

53639	2011	1	india	Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on January 19 rubbished the perception that stone pelters on Srinagar streets in 2010 summer were well to do, educated youth, saying a Government survey had proved they were jobless men from poor and mostly illiterate families, reported Times of India. We took a sample size — about 200 odd — of those injured and looked at their backgrounds, he said, adding, about 70 percent of them had uneducated mothers and about 60 per cent or more were from families where both father and the mother were uneducated. Omar said most protesters hadn t reached high school. This meant that an overwhelming majority (of protesters) came from families with no support system. Then they had no real hope for the future themselves. He, however, conceded that there might have been some educated youth involved as well with some economic opportunities as an incentive. The stone throwers weren t driven by alienation alone and the unrest had no correlation to militancy, he said. In spite of the four month agitation, militancy figures vis a vis 2009 are roughly the same. There is a marginal increase or decrease in some categories that we access, but there is no spurt in militancy, he argued. On troops cut he said that the State Government is ready to put in more than 5,000 locally recruited Policemen, trained as commandos, to tackle possible separatist protests like the ones seen in 2010, and fill the void that will be created when the Centre pulls out paramilitary forces from the Valley and parts of Jammu. In fact, nearly 40,000 personnel (both from Army and paramilitary) had been relocated from populated areas in the State in 2009 when there was a period of calm. They all had to move in again after street violence erupted in 2010. Removal of bunkers, revoking the operation of Disturbed Areas Act from some urban areas and recruitment of local youths in State Police, paramilitary forces and Army are some of the other measures that are at different stages of implementation. Asked about his Government’s stand on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), Omar said it is not a mere political cry for my Government. It is a reflection of the sentiments of people who want to get rid of the laws that were imposed two decades back when the situation was abnormal , adds Daily Excelsior. Favouring amendments AFSPA or its removal from some areas of the State, Omar said, As the semblance of normalcy was visible on the ground we have already starting reducing the number of boots on the ground. Dismantling of some bunkers from city and adjoining areas was the first step in the process and we hope to continue until we reach a level where the visible presence is greatly reduced at least.”

The details of the accord have not been released by the Government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that signing of the accord was historic and praised NSCN IM leaders T. Muivah and Isak Swu for showing wisdom and courage and for making this effort which resulted in the historical agreement. After signing the pact, NSCN IM ‘general secretary’ Thuingaleng Muivah stated that “Better understanding has been arrived at and a framework agreement has been concluded, based on the unique history and position of the Nagas and recognising the universal principle that in a democracy sovereignty lies with the people.” The agreement was the culmination of over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 16 years, with the first breakthrough coming in 1997 when a ceasefire agreement was sealed. Prime Minister stated that “Today, we mark not merely the end of a problem, but the beginning of a new future. We will not only try to heal wounds and resolve problems, but also be your partner as you restore your pride and prestige”. The Telegraph reports that the accord is actually a framework of agreement that lays the broad contours under which new rules of the game will be written and signed, probably three months from now. Prime Minister stated that NSCN s accord will not only inspire other insurgent groups to return to peace but also want NSCN to be partners in protecting the eastern frontier with Myanmar. The Indian Express on August 3 reports that peace deal rests on a breakthrough formula which does not involve redrawing the state’s borders. Instead, the sources said, the deal involves creating a mechanism which would create institutions allowing autonomy to Naga tribes living across the border in Manipur. In addition, the sources said, negotiators had agreed to set up a mechanism to discuss decommissioning of arms now held by NSCN IM. NSCN IM’s main demand had been of a Greater Nagalim , which would include all contiguous Naga inhabited areas in Manipur, Assam, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. Further, R.N Ravi, the chief interlocutor of GoI for Naga peace talks stated that the agreement was signed in view of the request made by NSCN IM ‘chairman’ Isak Chishi Swu, who wanted an agreement signed between the two entities in his lifetime. Asked what the “major issues” were agreed upon, Ravi, refused to divulge much but admitted, that issues such as sovereignty and integration was also deliberated and some formula worked out for them. On the signing of ‘Naga Peace Accord’, Ravi said “Nagas have suffered all these years because of lack of understanding. Their dignity and pride has to be restored. Their uniqueness will be reflected in all the competencies.” Emissary to collective leadership of NSCN IM, V.S Atem, stated that “we have agreed to share sovereign power with each other”. Asked whether integration issue was also agreed upon, Atem claimed that “everything was on board” adding “yes integration will be in the agreement”, reports Nagaland Post on August 4. A statement issued by Nagaland Chief Minister s office stated “The chief minister has expressed confidence that both parties have taken into account the aspirations of the Nagas as expressed by the mass based Naga civil societies during their interaction with the interlocutor R.N. Ravi. Our people have been struggling for more than six decades for a settlement to the Naga issue, and the signing of the peace accord is a welcome step towards such a settlement. This positive development will pave the way for a permanent solution acceptable to the Nagas. Joyson Mazamo of Naga Hoho (apex body of Naga tribes) stated that “Until and unless we see the contents of the accord, it is difficult to say anything. We were not involved in the talks with the government, though. The I M group does not represent the entire Nagas but it has popular support.”, reports The Hindu.

Most of the Pakistani militants killed were affiliated to Lashkar e Toiba (LeT), according to statistics posted on the State Police website. A total of 323 militants were killed from 1998 to 2002 when LeT and Jaish e Mohammad (JeM) outfits launched a series of suicide attacks on military and police installations. The four year period coincided with eruption of Kargil war when the influx of Pakistani militants affiliated to LeT and JeM increased into the state. The number of Pakistani militants killed in the State declined after 9 11 terror strikes in the US, apparently due to the pressure exerted by Washington on Islamabad to curb militant activities on its soil.

3309	2015	5	india	According to a recent analysis of the terror risk to 1,300 commercial hubs and urban centres around the world by Maplecroft, a global risk and strategic consulting firm based in United Kingdom (UK), two Indian cities Imphal in Manipur (ranked 32) and Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir (ranked 49) have been named to be at extreme risk of a terrorist attacks, mainly aiming to cause mass casualty and destroy public transport networks, reports The Times of India on May 22. The next major Indian city after these two that faces a terrorist threat is Chennai in Tamil Nadu even though the risk quotient has been marked as medium risk. Bangalore in Karnataka is the fourth most prone city even though it is placed at 204th in the global threat list followed by Pune (Maharashtra) and Hyderabad (Telangana) at 206th and 207th respectively. Cities like Nagpur in Maharashtra (ranked 210) and Kolkata in West Bengal (ranked 212) have been found to face a higher risk of a mass attack by terrorists that the usually expected targets like Delhi (ranked 447) and Mumbai (ranked 298). The analysis said that around 64 cities around the world are at extreme risk, with most in the Middle East and Asian region and three in Europe. Head of Maplecroft India, Arvind Ramakrishnan said When it comes to Imphal and Srinagar, terrorist attacks aren t on commercial targets as much as against the security forces. However in most of the other metropolitan cities, the targets are both to cause mass casualty and cripple its commercial hubs. Public transport networks in India are also prime targets . He added The 26 11 Mumbai attack in 2008 was the turning point for India. But lack of intelligence sharing among states is a big worry. Law and order is still a state subject in India and political rivalries across states leads to state intelligence agencies not sharing actionable data. Virtually all police forces in India lack modern equipment and adequate manpower to counter a terrorist threat. This brings down the overall morale of the force. India does not face threats from cross border terror organizations but also from home grown ones like the Indian Mujahideen (IM) .

6537	2015	11	india	With security and intelligence agencies keeping a close watch on social media platforms, terror outfits are now turning to the hidden web or Darknet to carry out clandestine activities, The Times of India reports on November 24. This, authorities say, has made it almost impossible for cops to track terror suspects and unearth their activities and propaganda. Experts define it as a network that promises anonymity and cannot be accessed without proper authorization, as several proxy servers are used to block entry. Terror outfits, as part of their modus operandi, send a link to this network to their associates on hisher email address. It is only when the receiver clicks on this link that heshe can access the information available on Darknet. Predictably, terror propaganda has shifted its base here from mainstream internet Darknet is also called the Deep Web. Online campaigners of the Islamic State (IS), whose single point of contact for recruitment is social networking sites like Facebook, too are said to taking shelter under Darknet. After winning people over, the campaigners, sources say , direct these prospective recruits to Darknet, whose websites remain hidden on a browser even after the correct URL is entered.

6411	2015	11	india	Islamic State (IS) terrorists are using every trick to finance their activities, from bank loans to government benefits schemes to exploitation of natural resources, according to an October 2015 report of Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Economic Times reports on November 18. The plenary meeting of the inter governmental task force, with a focus on terror financing activities of the IS, took place in Paris (France). According to investigations carried out by the task force members, one emerging trend includes foreign terrorists applying for small short term loans from banks, with no intention to repay them. The 50 page report on the IS states that a framework needs to be developed to choke funds for these terror groups. Besides India, member countries including the United States (US), France and Russia also highlighted the use of social media by the IS to raise funds. Fundraising advertisements are usually placed in social networks and thematic websites, as well as in specialized media, closed online forum and sent in private messages, the report says. A case in point is the pro IS Twitter handler Mehdi Masroor Biswas, who was arrested by Karnataka police for running shamiwitness. Explaining a modus operandi, the report says, Individuals associated with ISIL calls for donation via Twitter and asked the donors to contact them through Skype. Once on Skype, the donors are asked to buy an international prepaid card and send them the number of this prepaid card via Skype. The fundraiser will send this card number to one of his followers in a neighbouring country from Syria, who would sell this card number at a lower price and give the cash proceeds to ISIS. Another trend being noticed worldwide for terror financing is crowd funding techniques which is being used to transfer funds abroad by avoiding regulated financial entities. Canada s Financial Intelligence Unit shared its experience, saying the authorities recently zeroed in on an individual who left Canada, prompting an investigation. The probe was linked to a crowd funding website that allows people to easily set up fundraising web pages and collect donations.

1516	2015	2	india	Worried over attempts by outfits such as Islamic State (IS) to propagate jihadi ideology among young Indian Muslims, the Union Home Ministry (UHM) is studying an extremism counseling hotline set up recently by the Austrian authorities, for possible replication in India, The Times of India reports on February 10. Such a counselling facility, if found feasible in the Indian context, will enable parents, teachers and friends of vulnerable and indoctrinated youth to seek professional help for their deradicalisation . Keen to have a domestic counter radicalisation deradicalisation policy in place to stem the growing appeal of terror outfits among young Muslims, the Indian security establishment has started examining the best practices followed around the world to wean off sections attracted to jihadi ideology. This includes the US counter radicalisation program focused on community outreach, UK s Prevent and Channel programmes as well as Austria s latest deradicalisation counselling initiative. A senior officer of the Indian government said that while US and UK s deradicalization programmes appear to have met with limited success, the Austrian helpline centre, which is not linked to the police but manned by non profit groups, has got an encouraging response within a couple of months of its launch. The deradicalization centre also conducts educational lectures and puts out material to help identify potential threats. According to a Senior UHM official, a study of impact of deradicalization policies of the US and UK indicates an element of mistrust among their respective Muslim communities, with many members seeing these as a masked effort at spying . There have been many cases of recidivism among the deradicalised terror recruits. While the US counter radicalization efforts are focused on working with the communities to report suspicious activity, the UK s Prevent program seeks to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism through proper advice and support. Prevent works with sectors like education, criminal justice, faith, charities and online where there are risks of radicalization to be dealt with. A linked initiative called Channel helps to fight radicalization by giving individuals access to health and education, specialist mentoring and diversionary activities.

56577	2011	7	india	Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Centre will convene an all party meeting once the Interlocutors on Kashmir submit their recommendations for discussing them, Daily Excelsior reported. While no date on the submission of the report by the Interlocutors had been fixed, sources said that the final report may be handed over to the Government by the end of September 2011. The panel had submitted its interim report nearly six weeks back. The Interlocutors have so far made 10 visits to the State and covered 18 of the 22 Districts during which they have met nearly 5,000 people which includes political leaders, trade unions, lawyers, student unions and newly elected Panches and Sarpanches. The panel will now be visiting four remaining Districts—Shopian, Kupwara and Baramulla in Kashmir and Samba in Jammu after which they were expected to hold meetings with major political parties in the State to discuss broad contours of the report. In another context, Chidambaram said that the crucial phase of the new policy for return of youth of Jammu and Kashmir, who had crossed over to Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) for arms training in early 1990s and were now willing to join the mainstream, was extremely complicated and the Government is trying to address it, adds DNA. Replying to questions on whether Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) or other terror groups had abducted the youth who were willing to return to India, the minister said I do not know about all that. All I know is that the Government of Jammu and Kashmir received a certain number of applications for surrender and rehabilitation policy and they have been able to shortlist certain number of names to whom benefit of travel documents can be given to return to the Indian side of the LoC Line of Control . He said having reached that point now, the logistic problems are extremely complicated and were being addressed. He also noted, I think the Government State has learnt some lessons how to handle stone pelters. They are doing it much better this year. There are also far fewer cases of stone pelting. They are able to localise it and contain it. The Police and the Government has learnt lessons on how to handle stone pelting, he said. On the issue of infiltration, Chidambaram said that Pakistan based terror outfits were trying hard to push in their men from across the border but only a few such bids could materialise. The attempts to infiltrate are still high. The successful attempts are few, he said. To a question, he said, I think threats are exaggerated. There is a threat but I don t think we should exaggerate the threat. Things are certainly more normal today than they were couple of years ago. Certainly more normal than they were six seven years ago. Last year you must keep out the stone pelting and firing that was an unfortunate chapter. If you keep that out, you will find that you will see that the trend line of violence in Kashmir has declined.

18809	2014	12	india	State Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala on December 24, stuck to his assessment that the recent violent incidents in Wayanad and Palakkad Districts were nothing but the handiwork of miscreants posing as Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist), reports The Hindu on December 25. Even though the perpetrators of the violent acts had links with Maoist groups, there was nothing revolutionary in the actions. “It is sheer cowardice to indulge in violence in the dead of the night. There is nothing revolutionary about it…. There is no difference in the violence perpetrated by an ordinary anti social and those who were involved in the recent actions. The media should not glorify such incidents. These are just attempts to create a scare. We will mercilessly put down such people,” the Minister said while addressing a press conference in Thiruvananthapuram District. The Minister said the arrested persons had ties with Maoist groups, which were present in the State. However, they did not pose any threats in the State. Besides, these groups do not have the backing of the people. “Kerala is far ahead in the matter of tribal development when compared to the plight of tribes people in other States. Political parties and successive governments have consistently addressed the problems of the tribal population. The government was moving in the right direction,” he said. In reply to a question, Chennithala said the Police were fully alert. The government was serious about tackling Maoist threats, which were currently being addressed by Special Forces. It was natural to feel that nothing much was happening since it was important for the Police to maintain confidentiality. There were constraints in disclosing the strategies, but the Police have already indentified the roots and stringent action would be taken to suppress them.

3645	2015	6	india	Malaysian authorities have shared with India, the interrogation and other details pertaining to a Sri Lankan national, Mohammed Hussain, who had been arrested in Malaysia on the charge of conspiring to carry out terror strikes on the US and Israeli consulates in South India, NDTV reports on June 8. The case was cracked with the arrest of the Sri Lankan national Sakir Hussain on April 29, 2014. The interrogation report suggests that Hussain had admitted he was part of the conspiracy and had promised Sakir Hussain, his compatriot, to help reach two suicide bombers to the southern coast from Maldives, official sources said. While Hussain, who has been convicted, is at present serving a jail term in Tamil Nadu, co accused Sulaiman has been deported to Sri Lanka from Malaysian custody. National Investigation Agency (NIA) had requested Malaysia for details under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), signed by the two countries in 2012. In the interrogation report, he is alleged to have claimed that he had been tasked to ferry two terrorists from Maldives to a south Indian coast to carry out terror strike at US Consulate in Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and Israeli Consulate in Bangalore (Karnataka). The terror plot was foiled due to effective coordination by the Intelligence Bureau (IB) with foreign countries as Malaysia tipped off the central agency about an alleged conspiracy being hatched via Pakistan s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) backed groups in Sri Lanka to carry out the attacks. Malaysia had stumbled upon the case when its Special Unit was probing money laundering and human trafficking cases. Hussain was alleged to be in touch with Pakistani ISI officers. The probe was handed over to NIA by the Tamil Nadu Police so that the conspiracy hatched overseas including in Sri Lanka and Malaysia could be unravelled. Hussain has named Colombo based Pakistan High Commission s Visa Consular Amir Zubair Siddiqui as his handler, a charge denied by Islamabad. However, facing heat from India, Pakistan shifted Siddiqui out of Colombo. Hussain had told interrogators that Pakistan s ISI was behind the terror plot, the sources claimed. The reason for ISI to pick him up, according to Hussain, was that he had expertise in human trafficking, making forged passports, and smuggling Fake Indian Currency Note (FICN).
