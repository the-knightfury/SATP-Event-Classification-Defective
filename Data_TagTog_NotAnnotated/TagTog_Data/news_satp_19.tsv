7175	2015	1	pakistan	Supreme Court on January 6 restrained a local magistrate from proceeding on the bail application of Lashkar e Taiba (LeT) chief and mastermind of Mumbai 2008 attack (also known as 26 11) Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi until January 7,2014, when the apex court will take up the Government’s appeal against the suspension of his detention, reports Dawn. Also, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued notices to Lakhvi on the appeal filed by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), seeking cancellation of bail granted to him by the Anti Terrorism Court (ATC) in the Mumbai attacks case.A magistrate in Islamabad had to give a decision on the bail application, but a two judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja, stopped the judicial officer from passing any order until January 7. The court also issued notices to Lakhvi to answer the contention in the Government’s appeal, to be served upon him through the Adiala Jail superintendent, where the accused is currently detained. The court issued the notice with the observation that since there was also an IHC order in favour of Lakhvi, the court was also cognizant of the requirements of the fundamental rights of its citizens. “We will be lost if we deviate from the constitution,” Justice Khawaja observed.In a joint appeal, the Secretary Interior on behalf of the Federal Government, District Magistrate Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and Islamabad Senior Superintendent of Police, had sought the annulment of the December 29, 2014 Islamabad High Court (IHC) order, suspending Lakhvi’s detention orders. The Attorney General Salman Aslam Butt argued that High Court order was not sustainable in the light of earlier Supreme Court judgments and pointed out that Lakhvi was a member of the proscribed outfit Lashkar e Taiba (LeT) who was arrested in a terrorism case.But the court observed that the allegations against Lakhvi regarding his involvement in the Mumbai attacks was not relevant to the present appeal, since the court was only concerned with the West Pakistan Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) 1960, under which Lakhvi was currently detained.

2076	2015	3	india	Government of India (GoI) is unlikely to extend cease fire (CF) with the Khaplang faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN K) as it finds the top leaders of the outfit did not care about Nagas in India, provides shelter to anti Indian insurgent groups in its domain and also “happily settled in Myanmar”, reported Nagaland Post on March 13. The year long cease fire agreement with the NSCN K is scheduled to expire on April 29, 2015. Sources said that the Union Government has been “extremely unhappy” over the inordinate delay in reaching a final settlement to the 17 year long marathon peace talks with Isak Muivah faction of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN IM). It was in this context, that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) was likely to reject any more extension of cease fire agreement with NSCN K. GoI also believed to be upset over a report that other insurgent groups such as Peoples liberation Army (PLA), IK Songbijit faction of National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB IKS), Independent faction of United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA I) and National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) leader Biswamohan were “getting shelter and allowed to roam freely in the Khaplang domain in Myanmar.” A senior intelligence official stated that in India they roam freely under garb of cease fire agreement and at the same time hobnob with anti Indian terrorists in Myanmar. This dubious role can’t be allowed any more. This Government means business and it will not allow any such misadventure.” Apex student’s body of the Lotha community, Kyong Students’ Union (KSU), has apprised the Deputy Commissioner, Wokha, to devise a pro active and pragmatic policy with regard to Inner Line Permit (ILP) to control influx of illegal immigrants in the District, reports Nagaland Post on March 13.

Grossman also said that a new economic bloc that connects South and Central Asia with Pakistan and Afghanistan in the centre can play a key role in bringing peace to the region.

15287	2014	7	india	The intelligence agencies are scanning immigration data and missing persons reports in Police Stations across India to cull out suspicious disappearance of Muslim youths in strife torn regions across the globe, The Times of India reports on July 18. The data are being analyzed on the basis of available information and visits of youths to destinations where their presence is not justified for either religious reasons (eg haj) or employment purposes. Those having gone on haj but have not returned and those having lost contact with family are also being looked at closely. It s a mammoth task as close to 60, 00,000 Indians live in West Asia and thousands go to the region every year for jobs and pilgrimage. It s like looking for a pin in a haystack. Although we are applying elimination methods and sifting through data is being done based on collation of various information received, it is still a very difficult task. But it has to be done, said an officer from the security establishment. There are 10,000 Indians in Iraq alone. Thousands of Shias visit the country along with a smaller number of Sunnis for pilgrimage. Some of the latter are being suspected of having gone astray and joined the dreaded Islamic State of Iraq and Syria which has captured parts of Iraq and declared a caliphate. There is information that several youths visiting Turkey—a country which would not raise terror suspicion — have sneaked into Syria and Iraq. It is very difficult to track such movements, said the officer.But it s not just Iraq which is the problem. There are Indians visiting Dubai, Iran and Saudi Arabia only to later sneak into Pakistan and then Afghanistan. Several Indian Mujahideen (IM) operatives, some of whom are now fighting alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan, had fled to Pakistan via Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Two Karnataka youths, arrested by Bangalore Police in 2012 for targeting Hindu fundamentalists, had sneaked into Pakistan via Iran to fight in Afghanistan.
13070	2014	3	india	Barkat Ali, an alleged accomplice of suspected Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorist Mohammad Sakib Ansari, was arrested in Jodhpur (Rajasthan) on March 25 (today), reports The Times of India. Ali had managed to give Police the slip on March 23 and several Police teams had swung into action to catch him. Barkat had managed to escape as he was tipped off by his accomplice Adil about the arrest of Ansari before Police could raid his house. Adil was later arrested and several incriminating materials were seized from his house. We received information about his arrival at home this morning following which the police cordoned off his house and arrested him, a Police official said. Ali had allegedly supplied explosives and electronic detonating devices to Sakib, who was trained in making bombs and carrying out explosions by IM terrorist Zia Ur Rehman alias Waqas, who was arrested on March 22. In addition, The Times of India reports that a well coordinated network of IM sleeping cell was in existence in Rajasthan for the past few months. It was a completely different module of IM cropping up in Rajasthan. The three engineering students in Jaipur and Sabir in Jodhpur were in touch with each other. Mahroof and Sabir used to coordinate with Riyaz Bhatkal who is believed to be hiding in Karachi at the moment, said a source. Meanwhile, Waqas has confessed to undergoing intense training in Pakistan before he came to India to join IM, according to sources in the Delhi Police, NDTV reports on March 24. In 2010, Waqas allegedly underwent religious and weapons training in Pakistan for a year and was always motivated to carry out jihadi attacks. Waqas first trainer was a man named Taj Mohammed, who agreed to train Waqas at Naushera of Khushab District in Punjab province of Pakistan, along with a group of boys aged between 15 20 years. The overall head trainer at Naushera was Abu Manzoor. Waqas was trained on how to use a G2 gun, AK 47 and INSAS rifles. After the first round of training or Daura e aam at Pakistan, he was then sent to Waziristan, where he was trained along with 20 other boys. After a month of gun training, he was sent for a special training on making explosives. Waqas has allegedly said that his trainers taught him to make Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) with locally available ingredients like ammonium nitrate, hydrogen peroxide and potassium chloride. In another 10 days he learnt how to make six different types of battery circuits.Finally, by September 2010, he came to India where he was received by Tehseen Akhtar alias Monu, who took him to meet Yasin Bhatkal, arrested IM India operations cheif . Waqas has also confessed to taking part in Varanasi, Zaveri Bazaar, Dilsukhnagar blasts and Jama Masjid shoot out, say sources. The explosives were received Mangalore (Karnataka) and INR 1,00,000 in hawala (illegal money transaction) to buy the material and scooters on which the bombs were planted. In fact, Waqas had planted the bombs at Zaveri Bazaar himself. His image was captured on the CCTV, and Yasin Bhatkal had identified him in the footage to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) investigators. Indian Express reports on March 25, that Waqas told investigators that he had burnt two fingers while planting a bomb at Varanasi’s Sheetla Ghat in 2010 as its detonator exploded but he pretended to be a victim and escaped. Waqas, Police sources claimed, had told investigators that Yasin and he had taken an apartment on rent in Mumbai’s Byculla area before the attack and that he stayed in Mumbai for two months then. An Abdur Rehman alias Hashim Syed alias Hashim Pasha identified by Waqas as his Pakistani trainer, is suspected to be a former Pakistani military official Abdur Rehman Pasha first named by 26 11 accused David Headley during his interrogation by the NIA in 2010. Abdur Rehman Pasha has also been named by the US FBI as a key accused alongside Headley and Rana in a 2009 plot to attack the Danish newspaper Jyllands Posten in Copenhagen. He figures at number three in the list of 50 most wanted terrorists in India and has an Interpol red corner notice issued for his arrest on the request of Indian authorities. “Pasha has long been associated with operations in India. Headley believes that local Indian boys are involved in the Karachi setup,” the NIA said in its report. “Abdur Rehman is directly in touch with the top of brass of the Al Qaeda… has met Osama a number of times,” the NIA stated. The Times of India adds that sources said that IM s current leader in India, Tehsin Akhtar created this module. Waqas was entrusted with the task of teaching these students to put together IED. The three engineering students were a perfect fit for the IM s Rajasthan module as it was very easy for them to learn how to put together bombs. It is a very technical task involving electricity circuits to time the explosions. The technical background of these three students helped them learn it fast, said an officer. He added that engineers have been found to be part of IM in the past too. In addition, an advanced team of highly trained Pakistani terrorists was going to enter India next month to assist IM disrupt the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Indian Parliament) polls, an intelligence officer claimed on the basis of the interrogation of Waqas. Among top leaders, Amir Reza Khan, Iqbal and Riyaz Bhatkal, Mirza Shadab Baig, Dr Shahnawaz, Bada Sajid and Afeef Mota, are still in Pakistan. However, there are many fresh recruits who could rise up the ladder in time. Further, Waqas had stayed for three days at a lodge in Bandra (West) before leaving for Rajasthan. Sources in the Delhi Police s Special Cell said that before coming to Mumbai, Waqas had been hiding in a safe house in Kerala for some time. He took a train from Kerala to Mumbai, planning to go to Ajmer. We are interrogating him, said special cell commissioner SM Srivastava. Separately, all special division CID units in Tamil Nadu have been urged to keep tabs on activities of suspected fundamentalists following the arrest of Waqas and his accomplices, The Times of India reports on March 24. An un named Police officer said, IM men had earlier committed serial blasts in Bangalore and Hyderabad which are geographically close to Chennai.

4576	2015	7	india	A 32 page recruitment document in Urdu, titled, A Brief History of the Islamic State Caliphate (ISC), The Caliphate According to the Prophet , purported to have been written by Islamic State (IS) terrorists and obtained by the American Media Institute (AMI) through a Pakistani intermediary outlines a strategy to draw the US into an all out war by attacking India, The Times of India reports on July 30. The document reviewed and first published by USA Today, also details a plot to attack US soldiers as they withdraw from Afghanistan and target American diplomats and Pakistani officials.

This is the bitter truth, swallow it. Coming on the heels of Pakistani terrorists stepping up attacks on India, the document warns that preparations are underway for an assault on India and predicts that such an attack will draw the US into the battle and provoke a confrontation with America.

It was obtained by AMI, which said it has been authenticated by US intelligence officials. AMI also said it got the document from a Pakistani citizen with connections inside the Pakistani Taliban .

2050	2015	3	india	With Odisha figuring low among the States in the Police population ratio, the Assembly Standing Committee on Home Department has recommended a five year plan to augment the strength of civil Police, reports The New Indian Express on March 12. Currently, the sanctioned civil Police strength ratio stands at 81.05 per 100,000 population against the national average of 145.02. Interestingly, if the vacancy is taken into account, then State deploys just 71 civil policemen for 100,000 population. The panel, in its report, observed that the disparity could be attributed to a low civil police strength which needs to be raised. As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the civil police strength in the State stands at 30,850 in 2013. The panel has suggested a five year plan to scale up the civil police strength so that the police population ratio reached 100 per one lakh population. This can be done by creation of posts across the ranks and by putting in place required infrastructure both in urban and rural areas at a cost of INR 1.88 billion per annum. This can also address the growing law and order concerns, the panel observed. The House panel has suggested that a separate medical fund be created to provide emergency financial assistance for meeting the treatment cost of security personnel injured during anti Maoist operations.

2340	2015	3	india	The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the October 2, 2014 Bardhaman blast has come across a piece of land in Shantipally near Santiniketan in Birbhum District of West Bengal which it suspects would have been used by the Jama atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) to set up a colony for its operators, The Telegraph reports on March 29. Senior officers of the NIA linked the possible plan to set up the colony in Shantipally to operating a sleeper cell . They said a JMB leader in charge of the module in Birbhum had been instructed by his bosses in the neighbouring country to set up the colony. It was a dangerous proposition. They had planned to set up a colony in the heart of Birbhum to provide training and shelter to new recruits. Talha Sheikh, a Bangladeshi leader who was the organisational in charge of the group in Birbhum, had procured an Indian PAN card and used it to buy the plot in Shantipally, an NIA officer said. Talha is untraceable. Talha, known to be close to Sajid, the JMB s alleged pointman in Bengal, used to travel between Nadia District s Debagram and Birbhum District s Kirnahar, sources said. With an experience in training JMB recruits, especially in handling weapons and Improvised Explosive Devices (IED s), Talha was assigned the task of indoctrinating new recruits at the colony that was supposed to have come up at Shantipally. Talha Sheikh had earlier trained youths in Bardhaman and Birbhum. He was assigned to do the same thing here, an officer said. The piece of land is concrete proof that the JMB operators had found the location suitable to establish a base there, said an officer associated with the investigation. Birbhum came under the NIA s scanner after investigators found that a number of JMB operatives had stayed in villages in the District and used them as base to travel to and from Bardhaman.

30761	2013	11	india	The Centre’s satisfaction with peace accords in the Northeast is apparently being neutralised by deepening ethnic fault lines and Anti Talks outfits operating in the region, reports The Telegraph. Meanwhile, Speaking at the three day long annual conference of Directors General and Inspectors General of Police (DGP IGP) in New Delhi on November 21, Union Home Minister (UHM) Sushilkumar Shinde laid greater emphasis on Paresh Baruah led United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA Independent) having “spurned the overtures of the government” for talks than the Arabinda Rajkhowa led ULFA faction or the Ranjan Daimary faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) having come forward for parleys. UHM Shinde, also, said agitation for separate States by various groups had made lower Assam and Karbi Anglong “vulnerable to ethnic and communal” tensions. The interests of Rabhas, Garos, Bodos and non Bodo fail to reconcile, he added. “Special efforts are required to check the growing mistrust, particularly between Bodos and the non Bodos in the BTAD and its adjoining areas,” he said. The impact of the Bodo Muslim clashes in the BTAD in 2012 has clearly not been completely resolved. UHM Shinde further added, “In Manipur, the increased targeting of non Manipuris is an alarming trend”. Besides, a “spillover” of violence among Naga rebel outfits like the Isak Muivah and Khaplang factions of the NSCN has affected peace in Nagaland and in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tirap, Changlang and Longding Districts, said UHM. Sushil Kumar Shinde also asked Police Forces of the Northeastern States to strictly enforce the ceasefire agreements signed with different militant outfits. This, the minister said, would check the outfits from continuing with their extortion activities that have affected lives of common people. Shinde said Many of these (ceasefire) agreements are being flouted by the militants who are indulging in extortions affecting the lives of common people. Recently, there have been public protests in certain areas against such extortion activities. The State Police forces need to enforce the ceasefire agreements so that relief could be provided to the people. Also, Intelligence Bureau (IB), Director Asif Ibrahim Conceded “There are mixed indicators from the Northeast,” Ibrahim said that there were ethnic and communal issues in the Karbi, Koch Rajbongshi and Bodo areas. While these communities are asking for states, other communities in these regions are against separate state. Referring to the Bodoland Territorial Areas District (BTAD), he said the situation there was “fragile due to mistrust” between communities. Ibrahim also pointed to the “growing divide between the Meiteis and the Nagas”, in a way conceding that the Centre and the State Governments have not been able to prevent an increasing divide between the hills and the valley.

One of them is a Policeman while another is a released militant , he added. Sahai said that arrested policeman, Abdul Rashid Shigan, a constable of the armed Police and posted with the security wing, was operating under the shadow name of Omar Mukhtar and General Usman. He was acting as spokesman for Kashmir Islamic Movement, a shadow outfit of Hizb ul Mujahideen , the IGP added. He said that Shigan was working in coordination with a released militant, Imtiyaz Ahmad alias Raashid, in carrying out the attacks. He said that Shigan had a militancy background before he joined Police force in 1998. He was an Over Ground Worker of Harkat ul Mujahideen. He was discharged from Police department while undergoing training for his involvement in militant activities and detained under Public Safety Act for one year. He was reinstated on court orders in Police department in 2002 , added Sahai. He was recently transferred to security wing of the Police and was performing duty with Superintendent of Police Bandipora. The IGP said that Shigan confessed carrying out 13 attacks in Srinagar since January 2011.

Sahai said that militants are adopting new tactics of forming small modules, which were very difficult to uncover. He said that normally any militant attack that took place in Srinagar was solved in a couple of months but for the past 18 months January 2011 to July 2012 police had failed to uncover these 13 attacks which took place in Srinagar. He said that subversive activities of such kind where Policemen are involved are possible in militancy infested areas but Police have been able to uncover it. He said that such modules are working independently and they are difficult to uncover. He further said that the attacks they carried out had given an impression that militancy is on the rise in Srinagar. However, this is not correct. Statistically also the number of incidents has come down compared to last year, he added. It may be mentioned here that four Policemen were arrested in June 2012 for militant links and carrying out subversive activities in Srinagar city. With the arrest of Shigan all these cases have been solved, Sahai said, adds India Today.

27212	2013	5	india	The team of computer scientists from the University of Maryland in United States (US) has predicted that Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) will attack on either professional Security Forces and or public, symbolic, transport and tourist targets, in the next four months, Hindustan Times reports on May 31. The predictions are based on a set of models devised by a team led by Prof. V.S. Subrahmanian which are constructed on the basis of data of the terror group that were collected for 25 years, from 1985 to 2010. The data is recorded on a monthly basis and includes the values of approximately 770 variables for each month, Prof. Subrahmanian commented. Among such strategies, exposing unfavourable information about LeT leaders, particularly financial corruption, is the most effective one…Historically, when terrorist groups are under pressure, splinter groups like the Indian Mujaheedin IM carry out some of the deadliest attacks, he said. With counter terrorism as the goal, the scientists have attempted to forecast what LeT will resort to under a set of given environmental and action variables. While environmental variables relate to social, cultural, economic, military aspects in which LeT is operating, including state responses to terror, action variables relate to actions that LeT took.

7046	2015	12	india	An NIA (National Investigation Agency) official told that David Coleman Headley would remain the accused no. 1 in the 26 11 (November 26, 2008) Mumbai terror attack case, The Hindu reports on December 28. India is likely to tell the U.S. that the American investigation against Headley and the Lashkar e Taiba (LeT) was done because of the six Americans killed in the Mumbai attacks, but justice is yet to be done to the families of the large number of Indian victims. The development assumes significance as Headley’s offer is bound to help the Mumbai Police build a stronger case against Pakistan. Headley has been sentenced to 35 years in prison by a U.S. court and the clause of ‘double jeopardy’ debars punishment for the same crime twice. “Double jeopardy is a big impediment to the NIA getting the custody of Headley through extradition. But the U.S. authorities have to understand that they probed Headley’s role as six American nationals were killed in the attack. Indians also died, and what about justice to them,” asked a senior government official. Though India and the U.S. have a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), it can only be used to give evidence and not for prosecution. A senior Maharashtra official said there still existed a possibility of Headley being made an accused during the course of the trial, if his replies were not convincing.

According to the infographic, the United States (US) and Russia both have about 5,000 weapons each. France has 300, China possesses 250, the United Kingdom (UK), 225 and Israel 80.

It is a startling experience, looking at those comparisons.”

49361	2012	8	pakistan	Pakistan s former Ambassador to Washington, Hussain Haqqani, while addressing the Centre for the National Interest, a Washington think tank on August 23 said that the United States (US) and Pakistan should stop pretending they are allies and amicably divorce , reports The News. If in 65 years, you haven t been able to find sufficient common ground to live together, and you had three separations and four reaffirmations of marriage, then maybe the better way is to find friendship outside of the marital bond, Husain Haqqani said. A post alliance future would allow both countries to hold more realistic expectations of each other, cooperating where possible but perhaps without the sense of betrayal, which has become acute in Pakistan. He cited a survey by the Pew Research Centre released in June 2012 showing roughly three in four Pakistanis consider the US an enemy, even though the US pours billions of dollars of aid into the country. Referring to unrealistic expectations Haqqani further said it was just as unrealistic for Pakistanis to think that the US would side with Pakistan by launching war on India as it was for the US to think Pakistan would give up its nuclear weapons or sever ties with extremists. Equally unrealistic is that Pakistan ... will give up support for jihadi groups that it deems to be a subconventional force multiplier for regional influence, Haqqani added.
