57794	2011	9	india	After Assam, the Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist) has entered neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh and is starting a campaign against the hundreds of hydel projects that are being planned in the State, which has a high potential for hydro power, reports The Times of India. The presence of the Maoists in the State came to light when Arunachal Pradesh Police, jointly with the Army and Assam Police, arrested as many as nine Maoists from Lohit District. The revelation has come as surprise for Security Forces (SFs), who had arrested these people in connection with an arms and cash loot case that was believed to have been pulled off by United Liberation Front Asom (ULFA) cadres. What we found was that these nine persons were earlier engaged by Ulfa as carriers of food, information, medicine and men. But the interrogation revealed that they are members of a Maoist organization called Upper Assam Leading Committee of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). The arrested are all from Tinsukia in Assam, the source said. They have already set up a network in Arunachal Pradesh, mainly in Dibang valley district bordering China. Their agenda is to provoke the locals against the power projects that have been proposed in the district. They are working over ground as anti dam activists, the source said. Some of the biggest hydel power projects have been proposed in the Dibang valley. The construction of these projects, however, has not yet been started. What is more worrying for the security forces is that this Maoist organization enjoys the backing of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland Isak Muivah (NSCN IM) in Tirap District of Arunachal, bordering northern Nagaland, and also has good rapport with the Paresh Baruah faction of ULFA.

62922	2011	10	pakistan	The United States (US) on October 22 called on Pakistan to take action within “days and weeks” on dismantling Afghan terrorist havens and encouraging Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) into peace talks in order to end the 10 year old war, reported Daily Times. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared to extract recognition from Pakistan that it could do more in clamping down on Afghan militants using Pakistani soil to attack Americans but it offered no details on how. Accompanied by Central Investigation Agency (CIA) Director David Petraeus and US military officer General Martin Dempsey, she said Islamabad has a “critical role in supporting Afghanistan reconciliation and ending the conflict”. “We look to Pakistan to take strong steps to deny Afghan insurgents safe havens and to encourage the TTP to enter negotiations in good faith,” said Clinton after talks with Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, adding, “US was looking for operational action over not months and years, but days and weeks because we have a lot of work to do to realise our shared goals.” Clinton warned that stern action would have to be taken against Afghan and Pakistani terrorists if they did not cooperate in efforts to stabilise Afghanistan and pursue peace. If you have a snake in the backyard, you can t expect it to only bite the neighbors, Clinton said, according to ABC News. It s eventually going to bite you, she added. Meanwhile, Pakistan admitted it could cooperate more and achieve better results in clamping down on terrorist safe havens along the Afghan border, ruling out any question of official support for terrorists, reported Daily Times. Hina Rabbani Khar recognised that terrorists have safe havens on both sides of the porous border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. “Do safe havens exist Yes, they do exist on both sides. Do we need to cooperate Yes. We can cooperate more and achieve better results,” she said. “There is no question of any support by Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) Agency to safe havens,” Khar added. Later, during roundtable talks with anchorpersons of various TV channels, Clinton responded to questions on Pakistan US relations, particularly their joint efforts to fight the war on terror. When asked if the US was pondering to send its troops inside Pakistan, she categorically said this option was not being considered. “We don’t want to take action unilaterally we want to act in concert with our strategic partners like Pakistan and other allies.” In response to another query that ISI was involved in attack on the US embassy in Kabul through Haqqani Network, she categorically said,” We have no evidence of that.” Clinton admitted that the US had held one exploratory meeting with the Haqqani Network before a series of massive attacks. “In fact, the Pakistani Government officials helped to facilitate such a meeting,” she said. But “we’re not in any kind of negotiations. We’ve had one preliminary meeting just to see if they would show up.”

49192	2012	8	pakistan	Pakistan Today quoting a Congressional Report of Congressional Research Service (CRS) on August 8 reported that primarily aimed at India, Pakistan is making qualitative and quantitative improvements to its nuclear arsenal and “could increase the number of circumstances under which it would be willing to use nuclear weapons”. “Pakistan appears to be increasing its fissile production capability and improving its delivery vehicles in order to hedge against possible increases in India’s nuclear arsenal. Islamabad may also accelerate its current nuclear weapons efforts,” the independent CRS said. In its latest report, prepared for the United States (US) lawmakers, the CRS said Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program was mainly aimed at addressing the threat perception it had from India and thus act as a deterrent from India. “India has stated that it needs only a ‘credible minimum deterrent’, but has never defined what it means by such a deterrent and has refused to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,” it said, adding that Pakistani officials have stated that the Government may need to increase significantly its nuclear arsenal in response to possible Indian plans to do the same. Besides lowering the threshold for using nuclear weapons, Pakistan may also consider fielding non strategic nuclear weapons in order to increase the credibility of its nuclear deterrent versus Indian conventional military operations. Dated July 23, 2012, the CRS in its report said Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal probably consisted of approximately 90 110 nuclear warheads, although it could be larger.

45558	2012	1	pakistan	‘Secret talks’ between Pakistan’s Security Agencies and the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) who have reportedly splintered down into many different groups entered a decisive phase on January 4, reported Express Tribune. Now both sides are hoping their negotiations will culminate in a ‘lasting’ agreement which will restore peace in the country’s lawless tribal lands. “We have drawn the broader outlines for a possible accord. And what we’re now working on are minor details,” said an Intelligence Official, who claimed the results of the ‘year long’ peace process would be unveiled shortly. “Unlike the past, we are trying to have something workable and implementable this time around,” said the official referring to the failure of all three agreements the security institutions had with the TTP. “These are crucial times…we have to be extremely careful. A slight miscalculation can harm us in a big way,” the official, requesting anonymity, added in reference to changes in the regional war given the eventual withdrawal of the United States (US) led international forces by 2014. However, publicly, the military denies having any talks with the militants. Senior TTP associates also confirmed that these covert talks with the military establishment were reaching a climax and said there were several indications of things moving ahead.

At least people here think so,” Raqeebullah commented. Though it could not be confirmed, some officials said the TTP chief might have crossed into Afghanistan after sudden defections of his loyalists to pro Pakistan militant groups who were against launching attacks in the country’s mainland.

10623	2015	3	srilanka	Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran on March 10 claimed that there are about 300 political prisoners in Sri Lanka, reports Daily News. Sumanthiran was addressing the press following his meeting with Solicitor General Suhada Gamlath on the issue of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) detainees. However, Solicitor General Gamlath discounted this claim stating that it is unfair to claim that those who were taken into custody under the Prevention of Terrorism Act or under the Public Security Ordinance as political prisoners. He emphasized those arrests were made within a structured legal frame work and hence there are no political prisoners in the country. Sumanthiran said that the law has taken a different course for those who helped the LTTE by providing them with food and water, and they are still in detention though 11,900 detainees have already been rehabilitated. According to Sumanthiran, the group under custody could be divided as (1) those against whom no legal action has been instituted (2) those whose legal battle is completed and (3) those against whom legal action continues. The Committee to be appointed by the Solicitor General will conduct its first meeting on March 16, sources said.

49872	2012	9	pakistan	The United States (US) on September 20 said that although al Qaeda core in Pakistan has become a shadow of its former self, but other active terrorist groups continue to pose a direct threat to the interests of Washington and its allies, reports The Indian Express. Pakistani and Afghan militant groups Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Haqqani Network, and Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) continue to pose a direct threat to US interests and our allies in the region, where these groups probably will remain focused, said Matthew G Olsen, Director of the National Counterterrorism Centre (NCC). In his written testimony during a Congressional hearing, Olsen said over the past several years, sustained counter terrorism pressure has systematically degraded Pakistan based al Qaeda s leadership and operational capabilities. These efforts have left the group at its weakest point in the last ten years. Although core al Qaeda remains committed to its overarching goals, it is clearly a group in decline, he said. Noting that operationally, the core al Qaeda has not conducted any successful operation in the West since the 2005 London bombings, the group, however, remains committed to striking Western targets, including the US, Olsen added. The group s degraded capabilities will compel operational planners to place a greater emphasis on smaller, simpler plots that are easier to carry out against soft targets, he said.
61010	2011	6	pakistan	The United States should delay much of its multibillion dollar package to Pakistan pending economic reforms as the aid has led to official inaction and public resentment, Daily Times reported on June 1 quoting Centre for Global Development study. The report by the Centre for Global Development, a private Washington think tank, comes as more US lawmakers question aid to Pakistan after US forces discovered and killed Osama bin Laden. The United States in 2009 authorised a $7.5 billion package named after Senators John Kerry and Richard Lugar and Representative Howard Berman, who hoped to fight anti Americanism in Pakistan by switching the US focus from backing the military to building the economy and civilian institutions. But the study, the result of research that began well before the bin Laden raid, said the aid drive had paradoxically soured public perceptions of the United States as it raised false hopes for better times. And with Pakistani leaders now assuming a steady flow of cash from Washington, “it makes sense for them to push for that money rather than to work with their political rivals to move on key reforms”, it said. “For these reasons, we recommend that much of the $7.5 billion Kerry Lugar Berman aid package not be disbursed immediately,” it said.

19717	2014	3	pakistan	Lawyers for former President General (retired) Pervez Musharraf called on March 21 for his treason trial to be suspended because they claim the Government is colluding with elements of the judiciary to “fix and manipulate” the proceedings, reports Dawn.

In a statement issued in London, the lawyers called for an “immediate and unconditional suspension of the Special Court and a comprehensive investigation” into their claims.

20521	2014	6	pakistan	The National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) Act was passed in March 2013 but not a single meeting of the authority’s high powered Board of Governors (BoG), headed by the Prime Minister and comprising all the key Government players including spymasters, has been held as yet, The News reports on June 18. With terrorism haunting the country, NACTA direly needs a push from its board of Governors to take major counter terrorism policy decisions besides ensuring close coordination of agencies and improving the capacity of law enforcing agencies to check the terror attacks. The implementation of the recently approved National Internal Security Policy (NISP), which envisages multi dimensional measures to effectively address the incapacity of the state to counter terrorism, is also dependent on the authority’s decisions and approvals. Even otherwise, legally speaking, the NACTA BoG is bound under the law to meet at least once in each quarter of a year — four times a year. Ironically, despite this legal position, the NACTA BoG never met before or during the present Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML N) regime, which has completed one year.

Chidambaram said on August 4 that the July 13 blasts in Mumbai could be the handiwork of a homegrown terror module, possibly the one which also carried out the German Bakery blast in Pune (February 14, 2010), according to The Economic Times. He stated, The Pune terror attack was by an Indian module. In Mumbai too, all indications point to the role of an Indian module. This is the first official confirmation of investigations over the last three weeks throwing up a home grown jihadi outfit in all probability, Indian Mujahideen (IM), as the likely perpetrator of the Mumbai blasts that killed 26 people. Speaking on the larger issue of terrorism that India faces, Chidambaram said three facts needed to be kept in mind. One, India is located in the most troubled and vulnerable hotspot in the world with the epicentre of terrorism having shifted to Afghanistan Pakistan region. The second noticeable fact was that although there was no gain saying the fact that terror came from across the border, with terrorists infiltrating from Pakistan, Bangladesh Myanmar and Nepal and penetrating deep into the hinterland, home grown terrorist groups had emerged on the scene over the last few years.

Territorial integration of the Nagas is a natural necessity, not a choice or demand”.

60652	2011	5	pakistan	Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir said that Pakistan alerted the US to its suspicions about a compound where Osama Bin Laden was found hiding as far back as 2009.
