2177	2015	3	india	Union Home Minister (UHM) Rajnath Singh on March 19 reiterated his faith in the patriotism of Indian Muslims and asserted that influence of Islamic State (IS) was negligible on Indian youth, reports The Times of India. He, however, cautioned the global community on the appeal of IS among the young and educated and found the threat of do it yourself lone wolves real. Singh said, Influence of Islamic State on the Indian youth is negligible as just a handful of Indian youth have joined the ISIS and some have also returned after being persuaded by their families. The failure of ISIS to attract Indian Muslims is due to the complete integration of Indian Muslims into the national mainstream. Indian Muslims are patriots and are not swayed by fundamentalist ideologies. India as a country is proud of all its diversity. Singh, however, cautioned the audience about the influence of internet in spreading the ideology and said that the appeal of ISIS to the young, educated people, in spite of its medieval ideology, is a cause for concern to the global community. ISIS are adept at using the latest technologies to propagate their beliefs and deeds. They extensively use modern technology to reach out to wider audience with susceptible minds. The menace of terrorism is greatly amplified in today s digital world. Today a lone wolf or a DIY (Do It Yourself) Terrorist can go online and learn how to carry out an attack without ever leaving home. We have recently constituted an expert committee to look into all possible avenues of cybercrime and its linkages with the terrorist world, Singh added.

The Secretary General s report substantiates our view that it is terrorism, and not tribal differences or ethnic rivalries, which is the main source of insecurity and instability in Afghanistan, India s Ambassador to the UN Asoke Mukerji said at the Security Council debate on United Nations Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA) on March 16. He said that the terrorist groups, including the LeT, are active despite efforts of the valiant personnel of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) and the international coalition forces. It is obvious that their activity cannot be sustained without systematic state support from beyond Afghanistan s borders, Mr Mukerji said adding that reports indicate these groups are mutating into more virulent forms, in a region already impacted by terrorism. The Council must act against this threat with a sense of urgency, Mr Mukerji said. He said it is a critical decade of transformation for Afghanistan and reiterated India s commitment to stay the course in the war ravaged country. India is proud to call itself Afghanistan s first strategic partner. We share the Afghan people s vision of a strong, independent, united and prosperous state...India stands ready to do all that is possible within our capacities and our means, to work with the Afghan Government and its people, to realise this great vision, he added.

63354	2011	12	pakistan	Battered by Pakistani military operations and US drone strikes, the once formidable Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has splintered into more than 100 smaller factions, weakened and running short of cash, reported Daily Times quoting security officials, analysts and tribesmen from the insurgent heartland. “Today, the command structure of the TTP is splintered, weak and divided and they are running out of money,” said Mansur Mahsud, a senior researcher at the FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Area) Research Center. “In the bigger picture, this helps the Army and the Government because the TTP are now divided.” The first signs of cracks within the TTP appeared after its leader, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in a drone strike in August 5, 2009, Mahsud said. Since then, the group has steadily deteriorated. Set up in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation created to represent roughly 40 insurgent groups in the tribal belt plus al Qaeda linked groups headquartered in Pakistan’s eastern Punjab province. “In the different areas, leaders are making their own peace talks with the Government,” Mahsud added. “It could help the Pakistani Government and military separate more leaders from the TTP and more foot soldiers from their commanders.” The two biggest factors hammering away at the TTP’s unity are US drone strikes and Pakistani Army operations in the tribal region. Turf wars have flared as terrorists fleeing the Pakistani military operations have moved into territory controlled by other terrorists, sometimes sparking clashes between groups. And as leaders have been killed either by drones or the Pakistani army, lieutenants have fought among themselves over who will replace them.

57507	2011	9	india	Pakistan wanted to wind down militancy in Jammu and Kashmir in 2006, but failed due to a stiff 10 day protest by militant leaders, according to a US embassy cable from Islamabad released by Wikileaks, reports Hindustan Times. “The Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) had summoned the leaders of the Kashmiri militancy for a March 8, 2006, meeting in which the Government of Pakistan thanked the militants for their struggle, but then told them to lay down their arms and give the bilateral peace process a chance,” says the cable. The cable says that the militant leaders responded to Pakistan’s orders to stand down and accept financial cuts with a 10 day protest, and refused to leave the safe house in Islamabad where the meeting took place. Although the details varied, most accounts agreed on the basic message time had come for the militants to stop violence to allow space for President Pervez Musharraf and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to move forward with peace initiatives. According to the cable, Srinagar based separatist leader Yasin Malik, who heads the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), told the US that he had used his March April 2006 visit to Pakistan to reach out to Kashmiri militant leaders, counseling them to lay down arms and give the peace process a chance. The cable also stated that JKLF secretary general Mohammed Rafiq Dar said the confusion in the United Jihad Council (UJC) a conglomerate of leaders of militant groups active in Kashmir created an opening for Malik to advocate a ceasefire. For instance, Dar said Malik held several conversations with Hizb ul Mujahideen (HM) leader and UJC chairman Syed Salahuddin, who said he joined the protest in response to Pakistan’s orders out of comradeship. The US embassy adds a note to Salahuddin’s statement saying, “The syntax of Salahuddin’s remark suggesting that militancy will naturally die off if only the militants were given a seat at the table indicates that it was lifted straight from Malik’s talking points, which paraphrase Musharraf’s own thinking.” In 2006, Musharraf had proposed a four point formula, envisaging self rule in a Jammu and Kashmir demarcated into provinces.

33008	2013	5	pakistan	Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) Chairman Maulana Tahir Ashrafi, taking a taut position again on the ‘Fatwa on sanctity of vote as Islamic duty of every Muslim male and female’ has challenged the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), who are declaring the practice of democratic right of vote in Pakistan as a sin and holding terror attacks in response, for an open debate, Daily Times reported on May 3. Addressing a huge press conference at the Lahore Press Club, the PUC chairman called the TTP for holding a debate with him anywhere and anytime, and to give him a chance to explain the real teaching of Sharia (Islamic ideology) about the sanctity of vote with references from the Holy Quran and Sunnah. In support of his religious stance, Maulana Ashrafi said that casting vote is mandatory in the Islamic Sharia having three aspects first, it would be used as a testimony second, as a council and third, as an advise. He said that no Muslim, man or women, could avoid it under any circumstances, so stopping the people to use their right to vote was not according to Islam. He also highlighted the issue of TTP barring women to use their right to vote as ‘wrong’ and ‘itself a sin’. He said that it was necessary for women voters that they should be provided an opportunity to cast their votes in separate polling stations, where only female polling staffs were deputed.

27388	2013	6	india	The Telegraph reports that the March 8 arrest of three Bangladeshi nationals in Mizoram with a cache of sophisticated weapons has alarmed the Centre to order a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the arms bust. Rabi Chakma, Sabuj Chakma and Mani Tripura, all Bangladeshi nationals, were arrested after Mizoram Police and Assam Rifles recovered huge cache of arms and ammunition in two separate operations in Lengte village near the Lengpui airport, about 30 kms from Aizawl on March 8. They had smuggled the arms from Myanmar and were planning to take them to Bangladesh. An official source said that the NIA registered a case at its Guwahati branch on June 7 following an official notification issued by the Union home ministry directing it to conduct a detailed probe into the seizure. “The Centre has handed over the investigation to the NIA because two foreign countries are involved and moreover, the probe agency will also investigate whether any militant group of the Northeast is helping the Samiti to foment trouble in Bangladesh,” the source said. The source said another reason why the seizure had worried the home ministry was that Mizoram, showcased as an island of peace in troubled Northeast — was being increasingly used by rebels from other States as a corridor to smuggle arms and also to cross over to neighbouring countries seeking refuge or training. Increased vigil along the India Myanmar border in Manipur is another reason why Mizoram is now the preferred route. Mizoram shares a 722 km border with Myanmar and Bangladesh.

41315	2012	6	india	India has for the first time lodged a strong protest with Pakistan and given concrete evidence proving that Indian Mujahideen (IM), which has been responsible for a series of bomb blasts across the country, is a front of terror outfit Lashkar e Toiba (LeT), as reported on June 18, by Deccan Herald. New Delhi has also categorically told Islamabad that LeT was using the Pakistani soil to give training and other logistical support to the IM. The issue was discussed at length during the recently concluded home secretary level talk in Islamabad. Pakistan’s intelligence agency, Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), has for long been trying to project that IM was India’s internal problem of home grown terror as most of its members were Indians. The basic idea of ISI, intelligence sources said, behind floating IM was to show that terrorism was India’s own domestic issue and that Pakistan has nothing to do with it. But Indian intelligence and security agencies have now busted that myth giving a complete list during the secretary level talks to Pakistan of LeT’s terror camps in Pakistan where IM cadre, comprising mostly Indian recruits, were being trained. The details of this elaborate dossier reveals that LeT was using at least five camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) to train IM terrorists in use of making Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and training of arms and ammunitions. These important camps, which have been on the radar of Indian agencies, are Bait ul Mujahideen at Shawai Nalla Al Massada, Ibn Taymiyya, Abdullah Bin Masood, Masker Al Aqsa. All these training camps are in Muzaffarabad in PoK. The dossier also states that most of these men are launched across the border mostly through the Maskai e Ummalkura which is basically a tent camp used for transit close to the Indian border. The details provided by the Indian side go on to reveal that the top LeT commanders like Abu Muzammil and Abu Sama, are actively involved in training the IM terrorist. These two LeT operatives often cross over into India also to supervise Lashkar operations in the Kashmir Valley, particularly in North Kashmir. In addition, India also reiterated that the two founders of IM, Riaz and Iqbal Bhatkal, continue to live in Karachi under the ISI’s protection. “Information was also provided to Pakistan as to how Indian youth from various parts of the country are taken to Pakistan through Nepal and Bangladesh for training. This is the first time that India has taken up the IM issue with Pakistan so strongly,” a senior home ministry official said. The current chief of IM in India, Yasin Bhatkal, who is still on the run, is also suspected to have been trained by the LeT at these training centres in Muzaffarabad.

The report, submitted to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) in October, 2014, has flagged the mushrooming of unaided and unregulated madrasas along the Indo Bangladesh or Indo Nepal border in West Bengal, Assam and Terai region. Many of these seminaries have foreign teachers, mostly Bangladeshis who have worked closely with elements associated with outfits such as Jama atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). They digress from the normal religious teachings and correct interpretation of Islam by madrasas having Indian teachers, and highlight the alleged atrocities on Indian Muslims through videos and other provocative material. The aim is to exploit the feeling of alienation or discontent among young impressionable Muslims, with the larger purpose of radicalizing them to take up jihadi terror, said a senior official who has perused the report on madrasas across the country. Sources indicated that the government is contemplating a separate study to identify the foreign teachers who may be dispensing jihadi doctrine at madrasas, particularly those located close to the border with Bangladesh and Nepal. The concern over foreign instructors at Indian madrasas is explained by the fact that most of the Bardhaman blast accused are Bangladeshis who were indoctrinating Muslim men and women in West Bengal and teaching them how to make bombs for terror acts in Bangladesh as well as India.

7729	2015	3	pakistan	The Islamabad High Court on March 9 upheld the death sentence of Malik Mumtaz Qadri, the killer of former Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer, and struck down terrorism charges, reports Daily Times. Qadri was a bodyguard of Taseer and was convicted of shooting him dead in Islamabad on January 4, 2011. Anti Terrorism Court handed down double death sentences for murder and terrorism to Qadri in late 2011. He appealed the sentences, but IHC upheld the murder sentence though it struck down the sentence for terrorism. Judges Noorul Haq Qureshi and Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui dismissed the appeal over the murder charge. But they also set aside Qadri’s conviction on terrorism charges, which means it is highly unlikely he will be sent to the gallows any time soon. Qadri’s lawyer Mian Nazeer said they had not yet decided about appealing the Supreme Court, but were pleased with the ruling on the terrorism charges. “We have got relief by this decision. Charges against Qadri under provision seven of Anti Terrorism Act have been dropped,” Nazeer said.

61069	2011	6	pakistan	People of various tribal regions have refused to form anti Taliban lashkars (peace bodies) and demanded release of the 175 members of a jirga (tribal council) allegedly imprisoned in Mohmand Agency about a month ago.

He made it clear that in the prevailing situation the tribal people could not afford such steps. “The members and heads of various Qaumi lashkars (community militia) are being killed in different tribal and settled areas, but the Government has failed to arrest the killers,” he said and added that it was the government’s responsibility to protect lives of the people.

18811	2014	12	india	Terror outfit Islamic State (IS) appeared to have emerged as a threat factor in the Indian security radar during 2014, The Times of India reports on December 25. The arrest of a Bangalore based executive, Mehdi Masroor Biswas, who was operating a pro IS Twitter handle to propagate the ideology of the Middle East terrorist group, climaxed some disquieting events earlier in the year. The disappearance of four Mumbai youths in Iraq Syria and return of one of them raised concerns over how some of the Indian Muslim youths have become radicalized through social networking sites and other cyber outlets. Intelligence Bureau (IB) Chief Asif Ibrahim recently said there was an imminent danger of Indian youths moving to the conflict zone (Iraq Syria), emerging as a role model and such developments may directly or indirectly pose a threat to the country. The threat potential is accentuated with some lower rung elements returning from conflict zone, he had said. The Indian hinterland continues to remain the prime focus of Pakistan based terrorist outfits, particularly the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) and Indian Mujahideen (IM), as the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) found that these groups were setting up their infrastructure in Bangladesh and using the porous Indo Bangla border to send arms and ammunition into India. Blast in a madrasa (Islamic Seminary) in West Bengal s Bardhaman District has pointed out designs of the terrorists of the neighbouring country to set up bases in India. During 2014, the UMHA also extended the ban imposed on Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) saying if not curbed, the outfit will reorganise and disrupt the secular fabric of the country. The extension came as the government found that the activities of the outfit continue to be prejudicial to the integrity and security of the country .
35409	2013	11	pakistan	The News on November 12 (today) reported that while the Pakistani Government routinely denounces United States (US) drone strikes, locals say that a sizeable number of people in the country s tribal areas support them but the threat of Taliban reprisals makes them too terrified to speak out. Pakistan s lawless tribal areas along the Afghan border have borne the brunt of the US drone campaign since 2004, with hundreds of missile strikes targeting suspected al Qaeda and Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants. Anyone who does speak out in favour of the drones in the tribal areas runs the risk of being kidnapped tortured and murdered by militants their agonising last moments captured on camera. Anybody who supports drone strikes, they will try to kill him. They will say that person is pro American, a friend of the Jews, Gul Wali Wazir (name changed) from South Waziristan Agency of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) said. They will cut his throat or shoot him, they will film his false confession, kill him and leave the body on the road with a DVD and a note saying that anybody who supports America and drones will face the same fate. I have seen a dozen such dead bodies, he added. US spies are targeted by a special militant unit, the Ittehad e Mujahideen Khorasan, and grisly DVDs of their last moments distributed. A survey by the New America Foundation in 2010 found that a sizeable proportion of people, that is, more than one in five in the tribal areas backed drone strikes. Safdar Hayat Khan Dawar, former head of the Tribal Union of Journalists, from North Waziristan Agecy, the area most affected by drone strikes, said the missiles were the preferred solution to the problem of militancy. There are two options in FATA a military operation or the drone strikes, he said in an interview in Peshawar. The military option, people hate it because the army don t kill militants but civilians. So if you ask people to choose, they will choose drone attacks.

31116	2013	12	india	on December 9 that while the peace talk with a faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) is likely to see a final settlement soon, it is still uncertain when the vexed Naga issue could be resolved, said Union Home Joint Secretary North East In charge, Shambhu Singh. Talking exclusively to The Sangai Express, Shambhu Singh said that as of today, nothing is certain on what the outcome of the ongoing peace talks with the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland isak Muivah (NSCN IM) will be. Admitting that the dialogue with Isak Muivah led faction of the Naga rebel group has not seen any concrete progress, the Joint Secretary said that the outfit has submitted their charter of demands in July 2011 after abandoning the demand for sovereignty, unification of Naga areas and Nagalim. He said that as there is need for involvement and consent of the Governments of Manipur, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland regarding the demands of NSCN IM, the Centre is yet to give any reply to the Naga rebel group. On the other hand, dialogue with the pro talk faction of ULFA has witnessed considerable progress and a final settlement may come soon, Shambhu Singh said. Although, the Joint Secretary refused to disclose the demands raised by ULFA, he said that it was related to the protection of the identity of Assamese people.

Although, UNC has urged to upgrade the AA talk to a political level, the Centre has asked the State Government to resolve the matter with the UNC. Regarding the demand for a separate Kuki State, Shambhu Singh said that formation of a new State must be considered after assessing population, resources and area. A village is like a republic and these villages contribute to form India as a republic, he said.

2417	2015	4	india	Based on preliminary investigation, National Investigating Agency (NIA) has concluded that the three bombs, one of which exploded, found in a Patna (Bihar) house on March 30 belonging to one Kundan Kumar were meant for terror attacks, reports The Times of India. A powerful bomb packed with ammonium sulphate exploded and ripped through a flat in Bahadurpur housing colony on March 30 night. Following the blast, police recovered two more bombs while the occupants of the house escaped. A security officer privy to NIA investigations said “The bombs found live were very powerful with really thick pellets packed with considerable explosives. Had the three been exploded in a crowded place, it could have led to 50 55 casualties. The bombs had used timer devices which indicate the bombers were planning a terror attack. Naxalites do not use timers. Curiously, the bombs had the same timer, Lotus brand analogue clocks, as used in 2013 Patna and Bodh Gaya blasts. According to NIA charge sheets in the cases, the two blasts were executed by members of Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). Even the circuit is similar. But containers are different. Instead of pipes (as in Patna blasts), they have used milk cans. This, however, is no indicator of which group is behind this blast.

5807	2015	10	india	Indian Security Forces (SFs) have achieved greater success in thwarting terrorist infiltrations from Pakistan this year but at a greater cost as 34 men in uniform were martyred until September as compared to 25 in the corresponding period of 2014, reports The Times of India on October 8. Total incidents at 151 match the levels recorded until September last year and as many as 77 militants were killed over this period as against 78 in 2014, even though civilian fatal casualties are slightly lower at 16 from 19 last year. The latest infiltration figures accessed by TOI show a major decline in attempts, both successful and unsuccessful. In 81 attempts reported until September this year, 32 terrorists were neutralized by SFs manning the Line of Control (LoC) international border (IB), 37 were forced to return to the Pakistan side and two were arrested. Only 10 militants could successfully cross into Indian Territory. This is in stark contrast to the figures for 2014, when there were 222 attempts, ending in killing of 52 intruders and the turning back of 105 others, even as 65 managed to sneak into Jammu and Kashmir (J K). However, what is striking is the sharp rise in infiltration over the past two months of August and September, with attempts jumping 33 to 81 by September end from 61 in July. This is largely attributed to attempts to push in as many militants before winter sets in and the passes get blocked by snow. Attributing the rising component of local recruits vis a vis foreign militants in J K essentially to falling levels of infiltration , an intelligence operative claimed the stepped up guard at the LoC IB limited the successful infiltration attempts to just 10 as compared to 65 in the whole of last year. This has pushed up the percentage of local terrorists as part of the total numbers active in the Valley. Union Home Ministry sources said around 200 220 terrorists militants, both local and foreign, are estimated to be holed up in the Valley. Though they possess arms, not many are actively engaging the SFs in encounters. This could be due to their poor and inadequate training. Earlier the militants could exfiltrate and train at camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), but the heightened vigil by Indian forces at the border has made this a difficult proposition... not many local recruits are well versed in the use of arms, which has made them less of a worry to the security agencies, a senior officer in the security establishment told TOI. Sources said much of the local recruitment was taking place in Tral and Pulwama. Many of the new recruits are unable to adapt to the hard life of a militant that involves living in the jungles... they are not as committed or hardened and there have been some cases of these terrorists wanting to return to their families, said the officer.
12783	2014	3	india	Security sources stated that the I K Songbijit faction of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB IKS) is the most active militant outfit in lower and northern Assam region and the recent killing of an Additional Superintendent of Police in Sonitpur Gulzar Hussain on January 28 gave the outfit a new lease of life, reports The Assam Tribune on March 5. However, sources said that the killing was not a planned one and the militants managed to get the Police Officer by chance when he was leading an operation. Apart from that incident, the killing of Hindi speaking persons in Gossaigaon (Kokrajhar District) when the militants attacked a bus also was a morale booster for the militant group. NDFB IKS in recent times, has been able to continue with its activities in Chirang, Sonitpur and Udalguri Districts because of the network of informers that it has in the forest villages adds the report.

4701	2015	8	india	The Hind Camp can be found at the IS (Islamic State) dominated areas of Iraq and Syria for accommodating Indians joining the outfit, oneindia.com reports on August 4. The Hind Camp is the least crowded camps of the IS with just 7 members, the fact is that none of the Indian fighters barring one has been allowed to even touch a gun. As Areeb Majeed one of the four youth from Kalyan in Maharashtra had said upon his return, I did odd jobs at the Hind camp. None of the fighters barring one from Tamil Nadu who joined the IS in 2014 has been allowed on the battle field. All the rest of the IS recruits from India are assisting other fighters. The Indian recruits are meant to cook, clean and do other jobs for the fighters. However some of the Indians have posted pictures with assault rifles in their hand. This is more of a marketing stunt, an Intelligence Bureau (IB) official says. They hold guns pose for a photograph and post it on the internet so that others would be tempted to join the outfit. Most of the Indians who have joined the IS were lured in by false promises. Many felt that after a few rounds of training they would be sent into the battle field. The Areeb Majeed case is a classic example of what really happens at the IS camps where Indians are concerned. The IS finds the Indian recruits to be too frail and incapable of a battle.

5002	2015	8	india	The government introduced a standard format for recording seizures of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN), requiring all central and state agencies making such seizures to specify in detail the security features found on counterfeit notes, The Times of India reports on August 20. The agencies will now have to share pre forensic and post forensic observation for fakeness based on the currency design or water mark, presence of fluorescence, security thread etc, which is expected to demarcate high quality fake notes from low quality ones. A complete database on source of the seized currency, transit route and modus operandi of printing work and distribution is expected to help retrace the FICN to Pakistan. This information may be used to corner Islamabad at bilateral and multilateral forums. As per the new proforma, central and state agencies seizing FICN must mention details of the case file, including date and place of seizure, apart from denomination wise series and note number, currency design (water mark), fluorescence present, security thread, whether notes are of high quality or low quality, and pre FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) and post FSL observation for fakeness.

The agencies must mention the motive of the FICN circulation, inter state or international link, and the mode of transportation used. As for the accused, the proforma seeks their full personal details. Besides name, address and nationality, the agencies will also have to mention the religion of the accused. Other details sought include past convictions and links to past cases. Aadhaar and passport numbers of the accused are also to be recorded. Apart from this, central and state agencies will have to file a final report or court disposal proforma for FICN seizures, furnishing details such as date of disposal by the police and court, decision on FICN, name and parentage of accused convicted acquitted discharged and period of punishment of each accused.

5195	2015	8	india	The Indian Express reports on September 1 that Manipur Assembly unanimously passed three bills on August 31 Protection of Manipur People Bill, 2015 Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms (7th amendment) Bill, 2015 and Manipur Shops and Establishments (Second Amendment) Bill, 2015. The Protection of Manipur People Bill, 2015 is a prototype of Inner Line Permit System. The tribal student organizations claim that the three bills overlap Article 371 C of the Indian Constitution and Manipur Hill People Administration Regulation Act, 1947. The main objection, according to groups leading the protest, is to an amendment bill passed called Manipur Land Revenue Land Reform Act (7th Amendment Bill 2015). A member of Kuki Student Organisation (KSO) stated that “Our land is protected by the 6th schedule. We believe that the Manipur government has slyly introduced the Land Reforms Bill under the garb of ILP. In any case the tribals have not been supporting the Inner Line Permit (ILP) movement it is primarily a Meitei demand. We feel that by introducing the land Bill the Manipur government and the Meiteis will try and grab our land. The land in tribal hill areas is governed by customary laws and is held by the Chieftain on behalf of the villagers. With this Bill the land will fall under the deputy commissioners and the Manipur government, and they will try and take our land from us”. According to the report for the first time in years, traditional rivals Nagas and Kukis have come together to agitate against the bill in the face of “a common enemy’’. KSO member also added that “One of the clauses in the bills passed yesterday is to set 1951 as the base year to identify non indigenous people, who are regarded as outsiders. “But tribal society has not kept records of settlers. Besides the first elections were held in 1971. How are we to establish who is a late settler and who is not. This is just a ploy to get rid of us and reduce our numbers. State government has meanwhile hastily declared that the MLR LR amendment Bill will not harm the interest of those residing in the hills. State education minister M Okendro in a statement said the amendment of the MLR LR Act is to only lengthen the process for land buying by non Manipuri people non permanent residents and that in order to buy land non Manipuris must now submit an application to the respective deputy commissioners. He further said that the law will extend only to the four valley districts and not the tribal Hill Districts of Manipur.
5808	2015	10	india	Jammu and Kashmir (J K), which is still fighting militancy, is unable to overcome even the basic deficiencies in infrastructural facilities for State Police because of financial constraints. Moreover, the Police Modernization grant being given by UMHA has fallen victim to inordinate delay in furnishing of pending Utilization Certificates (UCs) of previous financial year despite the fact that crucial period of current financial year has already lapsed. Official sources said that J K Police is grappling with unprecedented deficiencies in infrastructural facilities mainly at Police Station and Police Post levels, which otherwise are first contact points for the people in distress. “Due to these deficiencies, the efficient and effective police functioning at these two important levels remain at stake and as primary function of watch and ward, patrolling and surveillance is getting hampered”, sources further said.

Moreover, numerous Police Stations and Police Posts are without reception, interrogation room and rest rooms. Even huge number of Police Stations and Police Posts lack desired level of mobility facilities thereby hampering the functioning of Jammu and Kashmir Police, which is not only vested with the responsibility of ensuring basic policing but also the task of maintaining hawk’s eye on the activities of anti national elements, sources revealed.
