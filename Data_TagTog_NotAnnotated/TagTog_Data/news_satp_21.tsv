60385	2011	4	pakistan	A high ranking US General, Admiral Robert Willard, Head of the US military’s Pacific Command, expressed concern to Congress on April 12 about the expanding reach of the Lashkar e Toiba (LeT), warning it was no longer solely focused on India or even South Asia, reports Dawn. LeT, one of the largest and best funded extremist militant outfits in the region is blamed for the November 2008 attacks on Mumbai, which killed 166 people in India’s commercial capital. The outfit was nurtured by Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) to fight India in Kashmir, and analysts say it is still unofficially tolerated even though Islamabad banned the outfit nearly a decade ago. Admiral Willard, told the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing that the United States was actively working with South Asian Governments including Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and India to contain LeT. But he cautioned that the group was active elsewhere. “Unquestionably they have spread their influence internationally and are no longer solely focused in South Asia and on India,” Willard told the Senate Armed Services Committee. The United States has evidence of LeT’s presence in Europe and the broader Asia Pacific region, he added. In the past, LeT has fielded militants in Canada and in the United States. India continues to be LeT’s main target. But Willard noted that the outfit has declared holy war against the United States and renewed longstanding concerns in Washington about attacks by LeT militants against US forces in Afghanistan.

32706	2013	4	pakistan	While US Navy seals in 2011 killed most wanted terrorist Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan in an oper ation led by its exter¬nal intelligence agency CIA, it has spared Islamabad sponsored terrorist camps that wage war against India, New Indian Express reported on April 8. US media on Sunday repo¬rted that Pakistan’s ISI and CIA made a secret pact to facilitate drone strikes against selective terrorist targets. Citing excerpts of a soon to be released book, American media said Pakistan gave access to US drone strikes on condition they would not target nuclear facilities and terrorist camps where Kashmiri militants underwent training for attacks against India. A New York Times report said back room bargains for covert drone wars began und¬er George W Bush and was expanded by President Barack Obama. “Pakistani intelligence off¬icials insisted they be allowed to approve each drone strike, giving them tight control over the list of targets. And they insis¬ted that drones fly only in narrow parts of tribal areas — ensuring they would not venture where Islamabad did not want Americans goi¬ng Pakistan’s nuclear facilities and mountain camps where Kashmiri militants were being trained for attac¬ks in India,” NYT reported, quoting excerpts from The Way of the Knife The CIA, a Secret Army, and a War at the Ends of the Earth.

15068	2014	7	india	Secretary of the Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist) Andhra Orissa Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC) Chandramouli termed the death of three Maoist cadres in an exchange of fire with Police in Nallamalla forests of Guntur District on June 21, 2014 as a fake encounter, reports The Hindu on July 8. In a statement sent to media, he claimed that the Police had captured Maoists Ashok, Bharati and Vimala and tortured them before staging a fake encounter at Murarikurava Vaagu on the banks of Krishna river on the borders of Prakasam, Guntur and Mahaboobnagar Districts. He contested the claims of Inspector General of Police (IG) Sunil Kumar that the Police had recovered an AK 47, a Self Loading Rifle (SLR) and a .303 rifle from the site of the encounter and that fourth extremist, Srinivas alias Vikram, was injured and had escaped. He further said in 2006 when the Maoists decided to withdraw from Nallamalla after it had become weak there, Maoist Baburao along with Bharati and Vimala had decided to stay back due to sentimental attachment to the place. They were working with the Chenchus there for the past eight years and helping rebuild the party base there. They were carrying only .303 rifles and tapanchas for their self defence and did not possess any automatic or semi automatic weapons. He also said that after N. Chandrababu Naidu took over reins, the State Government resumed its pro World Bank stance and decided to crush the Maoists.

6656	2015	11	india	India s efforts to get Abdul Wahid Siddibapa, the alleged financer of Indian Mujahideen (IM), deported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have come to a nought, with the West Asian country making it clear that Wahid will be sent to India only after extradition process is complete, Economic Times reports on December 1. Wahid, who was caught in the UAE in 2014 on the basis of a Red Corner Notice, is wanted in connection with the conspiracy in a series of bomb blasts including 2006 Mumbai serial blasts, 2008 Delhi serial blasts and 2010 Chinnaswamy Stadium blasts in Bengaluru, officials said. His name first cropped up during the interrogations of Yasin Bhatkal, who was arrested in August 2013 near India Nepal border. Based on the description given by Bhatkal, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) got an Interpol s Red Corner Notice issued against Wahid. Central Bureau of Investigation officials said that Wahid could have been deported earlier had the information between the Indian agencies been shared on time. The delays lead to Wahid being produced before a magistrate, which left extradition as the only option. According to government officials, Pakistan is using its diplomatic channels to stall the extradition of Wahid at the behest of the top leadership of IM. He is one of the key financer of IM who had helped them in logistics and his arrest has dented their capabilities, said an NIA official. Wahid is the son of Bhatkal s father s cousin and has been based in Dubai for past 10 years where he is said to have multiple business interests. His extradition will be a huge success for Indian agencies , a senior official said.

It added they have a meticulous system of accounting, and are very good at book keeping.

54029	2011	2	india	According to Times of India, on February 15, the Chief of the Army s central command surveyed Abujmad forests from the air and then landed in Raipur to allay anxieties over a potential conflict escalation in the Communist Party of India Maoist (CPI Maoist) controlled forest in Narayanpur District where the Army plans to train its troops. We will exercise maximum restraint in Abujmad. This is our country, they are our people, said Lieutenant General Vijay Ahluwalia, emphasising that the Army would be deployed solely for the purpose of training. He said the training will be restricted to manoeuvres with no firing drills and that it would be gradually scaled up to the brigade level. The time frame will be dictated by the consultations with the State Government, he said, adding that Chhattisgarh Government had offered 500 square kilometers to the Army for jungle warfare training in 2007. We are considering 2 3 locations. The area could be 20 x 25 kilometers or larger . Later, he added that the process was being delayed since there were no revenue records for the land on offer.

Abujmad is an unsurveyed forest spread over 4000 square kilometers, with not a single Police post, and barely any civil administration. It is believed to be controlled by Maoists, who have declared it a liberated area .

35725	2013	12	pakistan	After nearly eight years of a myriad of missing persons’ cases filed in the apex and high courts, a long awaited judgment was passed by the Supreme Court on December 10, officially declaring prolonged and unannounced detention by Security Forces and intelligence outfits illegal, reports The Express Tribune. The three judge bench, led by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, ordered Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as well as the Governor and Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to ensure the recovery of the missing persons in seven days and submit a report before the Supreme Court’s registrar and only after strict action was initiated against those found responsible for the enforced disappearances. The judgment in the 35 missing persons’ case also highlighted that the stance of army authorities that 35 missing persons were not in their custody proved to be false as they had made three contradictory statements before the court and they only produced seven persons out of the 35, the court observed. It was stressed that no intelligence or security agency, including the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), Military Intelligence (MI), Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Frontier Corps, could forcibly detain any person secretly for a longer period without sharing information about his whereabouts. The verdict passed the responsibility to the Civilian Government to ensure the recovery of the missing persons and for action against those who caused them. Since no law exists for the detention of the undeclared interned persons except for in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the rest of the provinces should also come out with proper legislation to discourage the tendency of enforced disappearances, according to the judgment.

In September 20 case, the consignment was sent by Shahiduzzaman, a Bangladeshi national (passport no BC 0635715), who hails from Hathhazari, Chittagong District, but is a resident of Dubai. Suspected to be closely associated with the Pakistani agencies, he has been using his business contacts and network in Chittagong to assist smuggling of contraband through the Chittagong area primarily targeted for the adjoining north east India. The interrogation of the five arrested in the case has revealed that the FICN assignment was to be taken to Comilla and Feni Districts along the Tripura border.

The Pakistan inspired FICN rackets are seen as Islamabad s covert economic warfare to undermine India s national economy. A senior Indian intelligence official said Bangladeshi authorities have been vigilant and alert to actively counter and thwart the FICN network and are working in close tandem with international agencies.

There are speculations that Musharraf is likely to leave the country, as the General Headquarters (GHQ) reportedly presses the Government to pave way for the ex general’s safe exit from Pakistan given that he has been indicted in the high treason case. However, the Federal Ministry for Interior is yet to decide on removing Musharraf’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL). According to sources, the majority of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML N) leaders opposed removing Musharraf’s name from the ECL, arguing that punishing him would ensure that there would be “no future violations of the constitution”.

The meeting failed to reach a decision on the issue and the Prime Minister has summoned his close associates to discuss this issue in the coming days.

The Udayan states that the Northern Province Governor should be a civilian. Whether civilian or not is irrelevant. The only thing that matters is the person who is appointed should work with dedication for the public in boosting Northern development. Such baseless statements made to overcome the narrow minded political objectives are subject to the aversion of the Tamil people in the Northern Province.” The Udayan newspaper recently commenting on conditions related to the Northern Provincial Councils election in its editorial states that holding the Northern Provincial Council Election is not conducive, Colombo Page reported on May 20.

8051	2015	4	pakistan	Pakistan’s former Ambassador to the United States (US), Hussain Haqqani, strongly opposed the use of American military aid to fight extremists in Pakistan and said instead it will fuel conflict in South Asia, reports Dawn. The Obama administration on April 7, 2015, announced to sell almost USD 1 billion worth of attack helicopters, missiles and other equipment to Pakistan. Haqqani said, “Pakistan’s failure to tackle its jihadist challenge is not the result of a lack of arms but reflects an absence of will, adding, With nuclear weapons, Pakistan no longer has any reason to feel insecure about being overrun by a larger Indian conventional force. For the US to continue supplying a Pakistani military that is much larger than the country can afford, will only invigorate Pakistani militancy and militarism at the expense of its 200 million people, one third of whom continue to live at less than a dollar a day per household.” The former ambassador said that unless Pakistan changes its worldview, American weapons will end up being used to fight or menace India and perceived domestic enemies instead of being deployed against jihadists. “Competition with India remains the overriding consideration in Pakistan’s foreign and domestic policies. By aiding Pakistan over the years, some USD 40 billion since 1950, according to the Congressional Research Service, the US has fed Pakistan’s delusion of being India’s regional military equal. Seeking security against a much larger neighbour is a rational objective but seeking parity with it on a constant basis is not. Instead of selling more military equipment to Pakistan, US officials should convince Pakistan that its ambitions of rivaling India are akin to Belgium trying to rival France or Germany, he said.

43882	2012	10	india	Nagaland Post reports on October 2 that Chinese and Pakistani intelligence agencies are working in tandem to create mayhem in India’s Northeastern region. Counter terrorism officials have gathered intelligence that the Chinese agencies are financing and providing assistance to Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) to keep insurgent groups active in the Northeast. A note prepared by the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) on the recent unrest in the Northeast says, “ISI is being used by Chinese intelligence agencies as a surrogate.” The note has been forwarded to the home ministry. According to intelligence agencies, Indian insurgent groups are being provided assistance in the form of money and weapons by the Chinese agencies through ISI. Intelligence officials also suspect that the violence in Assam in which more than 80 people were killed could have been part of a “bigger conspiracy”. The linkages of the ISI, which has a strong base in states such as Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Manipur, with the Chinese agencies, have become a major cause of concern in India. Experts believe this is a deadly cocktail of terror that is being used to destabilize the country. “Till the mid 1970s the Chinese were directly involved in creating trouble in North East.

6193	2015	11	india	Terrorist violence in Jammu and Kashmir (J K) in 2015 has surpassed the levels recorded in 2014, with 169 incidents and 35 Security Force (SF) personnel killed until October 25, as compared to 167 incidents and 30 force casualties in the corresponding period last year, reports The Times of India on November 3. Though 86 terrorists were neutralized till October 25, against 83 in the same period of 2014, and the civilian casualties caused while maintaining law and order stagnated at four, the number of civilian killings by the militants fell to 16 from 20 last year. The latest statistics mark a year on year increase in most terror indices related to J K. In fact, at 169 incidents until October 25, the figure of 170 incidents recorded in the whole of 2014 is set to be surpassed soon. Nevertheless, incidents have shown a steady decline from the high of 488 recorded in 2010, followed by 340 in 2011 and 220 in 2012. The SFs killed in terrorism related incidents is lower than 2013 but higher than the 2011 and 2012 figure. Terrorists, wary of losing ground support, are going after SFs more than civilians. Civilian killings have fallen from 28 in 2014, though they exceeded the levels (15 fatal casualties) seen in 2012 and 2013. The SFs are not taking the higher casualties lying down and are retaliating in equal measure to terrorist attacks. As many as 86 terrorists were killed until October 25, as compared to 67 in 2013 and 72 in 2012. It remains to be seen if the 2015 figure of terrorist killings will surpass the 2014 mark of 110. According to Union Ministry Home Affairs (UMHA) sources, around 200 220 terrorists militants, both local and foreign, are estimated to be holed up in the Valley. Though they possess arms, not many are actively engaging SFs in encounters. This could be due to their poor and inadequate training. Earlier, militants could exfiltrate and train at camps in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) but the heightened vigil by Indian forces at the border has made this a difficult proposition... not many local recruits are well versed in the use of arms, which has made them less of a worry to the security agencies, a senior officer in the security establishment told TOI.

33748	2013	7	pakistan	The Abbottabad Commission has called for strengthening democratic control of state institutions and civilian oversight over so far unaccountable security and Intelligence Agencies if a national embarrassment like the one caused by the United States (US) raid of May 1 2, 2011, is to be avoided, reports Dawn on July 10 (today). The Commission, in the penultimate chapter of the 336 page report, made 32 wide ranging recommendations to address the issues identified during the course of its investigations and testimonies by key civilian and military functionaries. But strikingly, its suggestions repeatedly bemoaned “military hegemony” and emphasised on strengthening democracy. While it is said that the Commission concluded that it was a collective failure at all levels of the Government and a series of incidents of negligence and poor policy culminated in the May1 2 incident, the report appeared to be quite categorical about whom it found to be responsible as it noted “The failure was primarily an intelligence security failure that was rooted in political irresponsibility and military exercise of authority and influence in policy and administrative areas for which it neither had constitutional or legal authority, nor the necessary expertise and competence.” At another point in an oblique reference to the military and its spy agencies, it said systemic failure in the country was a “concrete outcome and product of acts of commission and omission of specific individuals and institutions, who usurp responsibilities that are not theirs”. There were several references to frequent military interventions as the cause of national woes, and a warning that threat of revival of military’s “green book ideology” persisted despite the army having faded from the political scenario under General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani.

On August 3, 2012 a military court convicted Brigadier Ali Khan, Major Sohail Akbar, Major Jawad Baseer, Major Inayat Aziz and Major Iftikhar for having links with HuT and sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for terms ranging from five years to 18 months.

31648	2013	1	pakistan	Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh, saw its deadliest year in two decades in 2012, with around 2,000 persons killed in violence linked to ethnic and political tensions, Daily Times reported January 8. According to the Citizens Police Liaison Committee, 2,124 people were killed in Karachi in 2012, the worst year since records began nearly 20 years ago. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) says 1,800 people died in targeted killings in the first nine months of 2012. In 2011, it put the number at 1,000, which was then the deadliest in 16 years. Police insist killings related to ethnic and sectarian disputes accounted for only 20 percent of the murders, but rights activists say a shortage of law enforcement officers is part of the problem. “Karachi is becoming a city where controlling violence is becoming increasingly difficult because of an insufficient police force, which is less than 30,000 for around 18 million people,” says Zohra Yusuf, HRCP chairwoman. Karachi, a business centre with a population of 18 million, accounts for 20 percent of GDP, 57 percent of tax revenue and elects 33 lawmakers to the Federal Parliament. Karachi has all the ingredients of an explosive cocktail gang warfare, land grabbings, drugs, extremism, political rivalries, ethnic tensions, extreme poverty and a mushrooming population owing to migration.

56312	2011	7	india	The US media on July 14 has pointed out that the attacks Mumbai on July 13 had all the markings of Lashkar e Toiba (LeT), according to Times of India. Whatever the investigation uncovers and it s still very early one thing is clear Those groups still operate despite international pressure on Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks of nearly three years ago, said the ProPublica report headlined Mumbai Attacks Renew Questions About Pakistan s Crackdown on Militants. The latest attack involved bombs planted in strategic locations, a recurring tactic used by Indian affiliates of Lashkar in recent years, it added. In the report, ProPublica s investigative journalist Sebastian Rotella said that during the past week, Pakistani leaders have criticised the Obama administration for ... withholding 800 million dollars in military aid. The latest Mumbai attacks could also turn out to be part of that shadow conflict. The Chicago Tribune said the attack appears to have been carried out by associates of two Chicago terrorists (David Headley and Tahawwur Rana) convicted in June. “While no group has claimed responsibility, and the Indian Government has not blamed anyone, Wednesday s attack has all the markings of LeT, radical Pakistani terrorists who employed a pair of Chicago men as scouts and planners, it said. The report said the coordinated explosions in the jewellery and financial districts of Mumbai are precisely the kinds of attacks that David Coleman Headley helped to plot for Pakistani terrorists. This latest assault was shorter, smaller and more precise, but no less unnerving. A report in the online edition of the Los Angeles Times said that in the aftermath of the Mumbai explosions, ... some suspicions focused on Pakistan based militant groups.
