16467	2014	9	india	Bruce Riedel, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analyst and National Security Council official for South Asia, accused the Pakistani military of stage managing the terror outfit s latest advance into India, Zee News reports on September 6. He also said that Pakistan should be warned that it will be placed on the list of states sponsoring terrorism. Riedel has directly blamed the Pakistan military and its intelligence outfit Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) for the renewed terror threats against India in order to secure gains in their country s political arena. There was no uncertainty that al Zawahiri recorded the latest video in his hideout in Pakistan, secured by the ISI, claimed Riedel. The domestic politics of Pakistan are central to this drama, and to this threat, he said. The analyst further underlined the increasing risks of renewed confrontation between Pakistan and India, adding the US should ponder over a unilateral step if another November 26, 2008 (26 11) Mumbai (Maharashtra) terror attacks take place. America would treat Pakistan as a pariah like North Korea. It certainly meets the criteria and has for decades. The first Bush administration seriously considered this measure in 1992, although such a step obviously would have immense consequences for US Pakistan relations, Riedel wrote. He further noted LeT Lashkar e Toiba is very close to the Pakistani military s ISI. LeT would not have taken such a highly provocative action without at least some advance nod from the Pakistani spies in the ISI and the generals who command them. LeT s leader, Hafeez Saeed, lives openly in Pakistan, frequently appears on television denouncing the United States, and is the darling of the ISI.”

5862	2015	10	india	President Pranab Mukherjee on October 11 stated, Terrorism emanating from our neighbourhood remains a major security threat to us. We believe that addressing this challenge should be a major priority of the international community. India believes that countries adopting a policy of selectiveness in identifying and dealing with terrorists especially those who allow these forces to thrive on their territories will eventually be endangered by very same actors. . He said India has and will remain committed to peaceful recourse in the external as well as internal policies. Instability in our neighbourhood can threaten our security and slow down our progress. At a time when the entire world is affected by the scourge of terrorism, it is important to recognise that India has been preoccupied with this menace for over four decades, he said. India has been actively working for strengthening the international regime against terrorism. We seek full and universal compliance, by all countries, with the counter terrorism measures initiated under the aegis of the UN, particularly the UNSC Resolution 1373 (2011) and UN Global Counter Terrorism (GCTS) adopted in 2006. India would like to see a collective effort by all the member states of the UN for the early conclusion and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism CTBT . It has been pending for over a decade. This comprehensive Convention would serve the cause of humanity by prohibiting states from facilitating or allowing their territories to be used for terrorist acts, he added.
62306	2011	8	pakistan	25 soldiers were killed when some 200 to 300 “terrorists” based in Afghanistan attacked seven paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) checkposts in Chitral District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa early in the morning of August 27, Pakistan’s military said in a statement.

The military said both Pakistani and Afghan fighters were involved. “At least 25 security forces personnel embraced shahadat (martyrdom) in the attack,” the statement said, adding that the attack was launched “from across the border”. About 20 of the militants were believed to have been killed. The border posts were overrun by militants, but reinforcements have now been sent, it said. The Pakistani military said that those believed to have co ordinated the raid including a radical cleric from the Swat valley, Maulana Fazlullah, and a Pakistani Taliban commander from Bajaur, Faqir Muhammad had previously fled into Afghanistan in the face of Pakistani military offensives. “Since their expulsion from their native areas, the terrorists have organised themselves in Kunar and Nuristan provinces with the support of local Afghan authorities,” the military’s statement said. It said the “scanty presence of NATO and ANA (Afghan National Army) forces” along the border had led to “safe havens” for militants on the Afghan side, allowing them to launch attacks in Pakistan. Intelligence about the presence of Pakistani militants and their Afghan supporters had been passed to NATO and Afghan authorities, the statement said. “But no worthwhile action has been taken against the terrorists and attack against Pakistani border posts have continued with impunity,” it said.

2379	2015	3	india	The National Investigating Agency (NIA) on March 30 filed the chargesheet in the October 2, 2014 Bardhaman blast case, before the NIA Special Judge at Bankshall Court (Kolkata, West Bengal) outlining a conspiracy by terror outfit Jama atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) to use Indian territory as a recruiting and training ground to overthrow the Bangladesh government and impose Sharia based Islamic rule, reports The Times of India. NIA says JMB s mission was to create a Greater Bangladesh with portions wrested from West Bengal. Over 164 pages, NIA details how JMB operators targeted West Bengal, Assam and Jharkhand to set up training camps. Its activities in India primarily included recruitment, radicalisation and training of vulnerable youths in a systematic and organised manner. The banned Bangladeshi outfit spread its network in four Bengal Districts — Nadia, Burdwan, Murshidabad and Birbhum, says the chargesheet, adding that a similar network was found in Sahebganj district of Jharkhand. These bases were used for organizing radicalisation programmes, meetings, fund collection drives and as hideouts for cadres and their families, an NIA officer said. The chargesheet says how terrorist training camps were conducted at some madrasas (Islamic seminary) and other hideouts where recruits, including women, were trained in firearms and explosives. The recruitment, radicalisation and training of vulnerable Indian youths was undertaken by members of JMB to prepare a large group of Indians, based on their common religious and linguistic identity, to join JMB and help overthrow the democratic government in Bangladesh, the NIA says. It names 21 people, including four Bangladeshi nationals. Eight of the accused are absconding. They include Indian operative Mohammad Yousuf alias Bakkar (the main man behind the Simulia madrassa training centre), recruiter Kader Gazi Rehman and hardcore Bangladeshi JMB leaders like its chief, Nasirullah, bomb maker Burhan Sheikh, Kausar and Talha Sheikh. NIA took statements from over 400 people, 250 of whom will be cited as prime witnesses in the case. During course of the investigation, 32 people were arraigned as accused of whom 16 have been arrested. They include Gulsona Bibi alias Rajiya Bibi alias Rumi, widow of Sakil Gazi who was killed in the blast, Alima Bibi alias Amina Bibi, wife of Abdul Hakim, who was injured, and Hakim himself. All three were arrested from the blast site. The others include Ziaul Haque, Amjad Ali Seikh, Mohammad Sahanur Alam alias Sahanur Alam, Shaikul Islam Khan, Mohammad Rezaul Karim alias Anwar, Habibur Rehman, Faizul Haque alias Dalim Sheikh, Giasuddin Munshi alias Gias Master and Mofajjul Ali alias Laden. Moreover, two suspects, Badre Alam Mollah and Khalid Mohammad have been released. Khalid, a Rohingya Muslim from Myanmar, had created a flutter in the defence establishment when he was arrested. However, NIA says he has little link with the blast. The accused have been individually charged under the t Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for being members of a terrorist gang, committing terrorist acts, conspiracy and for recruitment, funding and training of terrorists. They have also been charged under Indian Penal Code (IPC) for fraud, forgery and cheating and the Arms Act for possession and use of firearms and explosives.

46157	2012	2	pakistan	Home Department Report on February 14 reports that, “Target killings still continue in most parts of the country and major reasons behind these are sectarian, demographic changes, easy access to illicit weapons, mistrust among ethnic groups, family enmities and business rivalries”.

We have also set a multi tier deployment system.” Responding to another question regarding lull along the LoC, the GOC said high vigil along the borders by troops, placement of surveillance gadgets all along the LoC and internal situation in Pakistan are the main reason behind it. However, lack of local support is yet another reason for it, he added. Replying to another question, Nehra disclosed as per latest inputs nearly 175 Lashkar e Toiba (LeT) and Hizb ul Mujahideen (HM) militants were operating in the South of Pir Panjal, including Rajouri Poonch, Udhampur, Reasi, Banihal, Ramban and Doda.

ULFA ATF ‘central publicity chief ‘Arunodoi Dohotia said, “After so many pacts involving the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir turning out to be worth naught in the past, ULFA does not believe in any more treaties. Neither can independence be any kind of a pact. It is not for a pact or treaty that ULFA has waged a rebellion for the last 32 years, during which over 13,000 people laid down their lives.” Further Dohotia said, “It appears that Rajkhowa, who is on bail, is adopting an initiative towards a compromise and ULFA is not party to it. After so many sacrifices, ULFA cannot afford to let down people’s expectations, The All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) have been fighting for the state’s problems from a time when ULFA was not born and now an individual, Akhil Gogoi, is taking over the reins to fight for the cause of the state. But they have always been taking up their demands with the Centre. ULFA was not born to take up Assam’s issues with the Indian government. A pact with the Centre will defeat the very purpose of raising the outfit which we will never approve of.”

49742	2012	9	pakistan	The law and order record of Pakistan is not the best in the world, with Al Jazeera recently terming Karachi having the worst crime figures for a metropolitan city, reported The Express Tribune on September 11 (today). Journalist Ross Kemp explores the violent side of the City of Lights as part of his Extreme World series. The documentary shows Karachi, the economic hub of Pakistan and a city of 18 million people gripped by criminals, extortionists, kidnappers and murderers. He shows that political parties, which dominate the city, are allegedly in league with criminals in the city. The documentary claims that in 2011, only more than 2,000 people were killed across Karachi. It adds that around five people are brutally murdered every day on the streets of Karachi. The newspapers too are rife with news of kidnappings, target killings and torture. Throughout the documentary, Kemp presents an analysis on the burgeoning gangs in Lyari and the ineffectiveness of law enforcement agencies in curbing the prevailing law and order situation in the metropolis. According to statistics quoted by Kemp in the documentary, there is just one Police officer for every 2,000 people in Karachi. Unsurprisingly, the police find it impossible to curb crime in the city since their weapons are obsolete even as their opponents, the criminals, are equipped with the most sophisticated weaponry. Kemp points out that almost all Police units are under staffed and under paid apart from being a target of criminals.

General Austin said that “Tension between Pakistan and India also continue to threaten regional stability and largely drives Pakistan’s regional strategy, especially as it relates to Afghanistan,” adding, “Our desired end state is a stable sub region characterised by a low risk of conventional or nuclear war, with regional states committed to non interference with respect to their neighbors’ internal affairs, the denial of sanctuary for Violent Extremist Organistaions (VEOs), and the non proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).” He said that they had made substantial progress in efforts to strengthen cooperation with Pakistan over the past year. “The US Pakistan military to military relationship continues to improve. Key contributing factors are our Foreign Military Financing (FMF), international military education and training, and the Coalition Support Fund.” “We also prioritised our security cooperation at the Defense Consultative Group Conference with the goal to help Pakistan to build additional capacity in support of their counter insurgency and CT operations and other common objectives.” Furhter he said that while militants were present in the border areas, Pakistan had been taking action against them. “Violent extremist organisations, to include the remnants of core al Qaeda, continue to operate in Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and, to a lesser extent, parts of eastern Afghanistan.” He added that these groups threaten regional stability, plan attacks against the US and partner interests, and pursue WMD with Taliban insurgency continuing to present a credible threat to the Afghan Government. “We are encouraged by (Pakistan) leaderships’ commitment to counter insurgency operations in the FATA and openness to improve relations with Afghanistan,” he said, adding, “The Pakistani military’s recent operations to clear militant strongholds in North Waziristan and other FATA regions and to prevent the militants’ return have achieved near term successes. However, Pakistan will likely continue to face the threat of VEOs for the foreseeable future.”

11775	2014	1	india	Indian Mujahideen (IM) is more lethal and resilient because of the support it receives from Pakistan, according to a new report titled Jihadist Violence The Indian Threat by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, The Times of India reported on January 3. The report underlines that the Indian jihadist movement constitutes an internal security issue with an external dimension. The Indian jihadist movement formed organically and as a result of endogenous factors, specifically communal grievances and a desire for revenge, but is more lethal and more resilient than it otherwise would have been, thanks to external support from the Pakistani state and Pakistan and Bangladesh based militant groups, said the 100 page report. External support was a force multiplier for Indian militancy rather than a key driver of it. Although the IM receives support from LeT, it should not be viewed as an affiliate within the same command and control hierarchy. This distinguishes the IM from some of the other LeT cells or operatives active in India, it said. It argues that IM the primary indigenous jihadist threat is part of a larger universe of Islamist militant entities operating in India, many but not all of which are connected to external entities such as the Pakistani militant group LeT and the Bangladeshi Harkat ul Jihad al Islami (HuJI B). It also asserts that the IM should not be viewed as a formal organization, but instead is best understood as a label for a relatively amorphous network populated by jihadist elements from the fringes of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and the criminal underworld.

41280	2012	6	india	The officers of the Maharashtra anti terrorism squad (ATS) interrogating Indian Mujahideen (IM) operative Mohammed Kafeel Ahmed, in connection with July 13, 2011 (13 7) triple blasts in the city, have said that he is the key conduit in what is believed to be a well spread out hawala (illegal money transfer) network that channels underworld money to the terror group. Kafeel, the caretaker of a local mosque and well versed with scriptures, travelled across the country to spot and train fresh recruits into the IM cadre, ATS officials said. The interrogation has also revealed that Kafeel knows how the INR 3.75 crore ransom collected in the 2001 kidnapping of shoe baron Partho Roy Burman in West Bengal was routed through hawala channels. The Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) believe that the money was used to fund the 9 11 World Trade Centre attack in US, as well as the attack on the American Center at Kolkata in 2002, and that the kidnapping was carried out by persons who went on to form the home grown IM. His interrogation has revealed over a dozen names that play a crucial role in the IM set up. Kafeel, along with Muzaffar Kola could throw light on terror financing through hawala networks, said police sources. Kola, whom the ATS alleges to be the key person who channelled INR 10 lakh to 13 7 mastermind Yasin Bhatkal through his hawala network, was also involved in the transfer of ransom money in the Burman case.

1210	2015	1	india	India’s external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), has warned that the threat from home grown elements radicalised by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has emerged as the topmost terror threat across the globe even as the Afghanistan Pakistan region remains the epicentre of global terror activity, reports The Asian Age on January 24. In a detailed report on the ISIS inspired terrorist attacks in France, the RAW has said that the terrorists who carried out the deadly attack had connection with jihadists in AfPak. The report says that though the investigation into the attacks is still going on, it is evident that the terror attacks in France were mounted by home grown elements who got radicalised over the last decade or so. According to the assessment of the agency, France is one of the four countries, apart from the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and Israel, that have prominently figured in the propaganda of the al Qaeda networks and in recent times of the ISIS. In India, the security agencies are keeping a close watch on the international security scenario vis à vis the ISIS as recent activities of ISIS inspired Indian youth have come to their notice. For the Indian security agencies, a joint attack by the al Qaeda and ISIS on Indian cities remains a potent threat and a close watch is being kept on the social media as well as by liaising with counterparts in foreign countries to crack down on such attempts.

Moussaoui said he met in Afghanistan an official from the Saudi Embassy in Washington DC to discuss al Qaeda’s plots to attack the United States, and that he was supposed to meet the same man again in Washington for help on a plot to shoot down Air Force One.

49087	2012	8	pakistan	Federal Minister of Interior Rehman Malik on August 2 told the Senate that external aggression and world power game could not be ruled out in the Balochistan issue as the situation there was similar to that of East Pakistan in 1971, as he held the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Lashkar e Jhangvi (LeJ) responsible for all the major terrorism and kidnapping activities in the province, reports The Nation. Malik said hostile elements were exploiting the indigenous issue of the Balochistan and there was a planned external aggression linked to regional security, adding that a roadmap had been prepared to disintegrate Balochistan. “We are a nuclear power and it is threat for the world,” he added. The Minister questioned whether there were no human rights violations in Punjab and why such issues were highlighted in Balochistan and why a US Congressman took up the matter of Balochistan But he also answered these queries in the same breath and said it was because of a broader conspiracy. “We will have to find the solution before it is too late,” he said, adding that the slogan of an independent Balochistan was not a new phenomenon as similar movements were led by Nourez Khan in 1948 1950, Sher Mohammad Bijarani in 1963 69 and Kher Bukhsh Marri in 1973 78. He, however, claimed that the people of Balochistan trusted the Federation. “Baloch Separatists and nationalists have links with banned outfit, Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other proscribed organisations,” the Minister added. “LeJ is one of the main organisation that in support with the (BLA is involved in major terrorist activities in the province,” he added.

Malik said these figures were verifiable from provincial home department and intelligence agencies. He claimed that BLA was behind all these incidents. The minister alleged that the BLA was a killing machine and being controlled from Afghanistan, adding that terrorists from Afghanistan side crossed border and committed terror activities in Pakistan, while Maulvi Faqir Mohammad and Fazlullah were also hiding in Afghanistan. He told the house that Brahmdagh Bugti was involved in kidnapping of John Solecki, chief of the UN refugees’ office, and Hyrbyair Marri, while living in UK, used to make a call and people were killed in Balochistan. He, at the same time said, the BLA used to threaten the workers in Balochistan that were associated with different development projects there. Malik stressed that the problem of Balochistan was deprivation of the people of the area. “89 DMG posts and 50 PSP posts are lying vacant in the province,” he added. The Minister said there was a perception that the FC kidnapped and killed the people but the fact was the forces were there to protect the people of the area and borders. He said five per cent areas declared as ‘A’ in Balochistan were under the control of police and other areas marked as B under the control of levies.

18777	2014	12	india	Zarrar Shah, Lashkar e Toiba’s (LeT) technology chief had posed as an Indian businessman while negotiating to buy from an American company a Voice over Internet Phone service that was later used by the LeT handlers to communicate with the November 26, 2008 (26 11) Mumbai (Maharashtra) attackers while concealing their actual origin, Kashmir Reader reports on December 23. Zarrar Shah, had set up an internet phone system to disguise his location during the Mumbai attacks by routing his calls through New Jersey in United States (US). A detailed investigative report by the New York Times, ProPublica and the PBS series ‘Frontline’ titled ‘In 2008 Mumbai Killings, Piles of Spy Data, but an Uncompleted Puzzle,’ said that Shah, contacted the New Jersey company, “posing online as an Indian reseller of telephone services named Kharak Singh, purporting to be based in Mumbai.” Shah had set up the VoIP service through the New Jersey company, ensuring that many of his calls to the terrorists would bear the area code 201, concealing their actual origin. The report described Shah as a “digitally savvy operative” who had “strong ties to Pakistani intelligence and an intense hatred for India.” “As he made his plan, he searched on his laptop for weak communication security in Europe, spent time on a site designed to conceal browsing history, and searched Google News for “indian american naval exercises”— presumably so the seagoing attackers would not blunder into an overwhelming force,” it said. In mid September, 2008, during a session, which took place in a huge “media room” in a remote camp on the border with Jammu and Kashmir, Shah and fellow plotters used Google Earth and other material to show 26 11 attacker Ajmal Kasab and nine other militants their targets in Mumbai, according to court testimony.
20098	2014	5	pakistan	According to officials in the Police, the recent grouping within the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) may help the Government and Security Forces (SFs) to deal with the militants but it has created more trouble for businessmen in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, reports Dawn on May 3 (today). The sources said that the businessmen had paid extortions to the TTP but a few days later they again received calls for payment of more money. The second calls, they added, came even though middlemen of the militants had given assurances that the businessmen would not be threatened. The officials said the TTP groups worked under Shehryar Mehsud and Khan Said alias Sajna. The differences among them cropped up in the run up to the selection of the successor to Hakimullah Mehsud who was killed in a United States (US) drone attack in 2013. An official of the capital Police said that now the TTP groups were separately approaching businessmen to pay them extortion. A few days back the owner of a food outlet in the city received a telephone call demanding extortion equal to the amount he had already paid, he added. The businessman told the Police that he approached the middleman operating from the capital city as he had assured him that no one would harm him after he made the payment. However, when the businessman told the middleman about the call after the payment of extortion, the latter sought time to probe the matter.

62595	2011	9	pakistan	Pakistan’s Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani on September 26 scrapped a visit to London as Islamabad refused to bow to mounting US demands for action against al Qaeda linked Haqqani network holed up in the North Waziristan Agency reports Daily Times. The decision was taken at a special meeting of top commanders on September 25 and is likely to chip away at the deteriorating relationship between the two countries.

A public acknowledgement by the Army’s chief spokesman Major General Athar Abbas about Pakistan having contact with the Haqqanis also appears to confirm that the security establishment has no intention to go after one of the most feared Afghan insurgent groups. “Any intelligence agency would like to maintain contact with whatever opposition group, whatever terrorist organisation … for some positive outcome,” Major General Athar Abbas told CNN in a telephone interview.

61915	2011	7	pakistan	Pakistan on July 30 asked the United States to stop the CIA run unmanned air strikes into its tribal areas, Dawn quoting diplomatic sources reported. According to diplomatic sources, Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General Shuja Pasha told acting CIA Director Michael J. Morell that the raids had become a major source of embarrassment for the Pakistani Government as it was blamed for failing to stop a foreign power from killing its own citizens. Before this, Pakistan had publicly protested the strikes but had never officially asked the United States to discontinue them, although Pakistani leaders often complained that drones were killing too many innocent civilians. The Pakistanis say that since June 18, 2004, when the CIA began the drone strikes, the unmanned aircraft had killed more than 2,500 people, mostly civilians. The CIA has conducted almost 250 strikes since 2004. The strikes have jumped from fewer than 50 in the Bush administration, to more than 200 strikes since President Barack Obama took office. The US government, however, rejects such claims as incorrect, insisting that drones are extraordinarily accurate. “There hasn’t been a single collateral death” since last year, President Obama’s chief counter terrorism adviser John Brennan told a recent news briefing.

61965	2011	8	pakistan	Lauding the Indian leadership s willingness to engage Pakistan despite its failure to bring perpetrators of the 26 11 Mumbai attacks to justice, The New York Times on August 2 said that the Pakistani Army s use of militants to counter Indian influence in Kashmir is self destructive. In the editorial titled India and Pakistan, Talking Even modest progress is to be celebrated and urged forward, The New York Times said that homegrown extremism and not India is the real threat to Pakistan s survival. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India deserves huge credit for staying engaged despite Pakistan s failure to prosecute those responsible for the 26 11 Mumbai attack. And he deserves credit for not shooting first and asking questions later after the recent attacks. We wish we could say the same of Pakistan s leaders, the editorial said. Before there can be a true reconciliation, and stability in the region, Pakistan s Army must realise that using militants to try to counter Indian influence in Kashmir and Afghanistan is self destructive and that homegrown extremism, not India, is the real threat to Pakistan s survival. Describing the relationship between the two neighbours as combustible , the editorial said it is progress just to get the two sides in a room, in a reference to the recently concluded talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries. Last week s meeting was better. Their foreign ministers announced modest, but very welcome, agreements concerning ...Kashmir.
