The grid is coordinated and we are ready to take on the challenge.” The GOC said that militants are making desperate attempts to infiltrate and robust counter infiltration is foiling their attempts. “There has been no let up in the intent (to infiltrate) but the robust anti infiltration grid has ensured that the attempts are foiled,” he said.

Jharkhand Director General of Police (DGP) Rajiv Kumar who visited the area on July 3 said, “We have information that several top leaders of the Koel Sankh zone were having meetings in the area. We are proceeding cautiously as Maoists had planted explosives in the entire area. In some parts of the thick forest, they have occupied hilly terrain, where they will be an advantage.” Further, in an interview with Pioneer, the DGP said the Security Forces (SFs) will fight the Maoists to the finish in Kumandih jungle, spreading over 50 60 square kilometres.

31438	2013	12	india	According to a recent confidential forensic analysis report, the influx of Fake Indian Currency Note (FICN) into India is being seen as one of the biggest threats to the country s economic stability, IBNLive reported on December 26. In 2009 the Union Ministry of Home Affairs formed a high level secret panel for a comprehensive analysis of FICN recovered from across the country. What followed was a year long investigation in collaboration with the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the intelligence agencies. Samples of fake currency notes were collected from states of Maharashtra, Goa, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Jammu Kashmir. The fake notes were forensically compared with the genuine ones from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. The panel concluded by saying During examination of samples of FICN and the legal tender of Pakistan, most of the pivotal parameters of the paper like GSM of the paper, wax pick quotient, poly vinyle alcohol etc were found matching with the legal tender of Pakistan. The similarity in the furnish used i e 100 per cent rag content, PH of the paper and surface sizing clearly indicates that a similar manufacturing process has been adopted in case of the FICN samples and the legal tender of Pakistan. The FICN were almost 90 per cent similar to the genuine ones and impossible to spot with a naked eye. Some of the fake notes also display sophisticated features like security thread, watermarks, latent image among others. Some of the parameters used for the analysis are paper, ink, printing process, special features, thickness of the paper and colour registration. Alarmed by the recovery of FICN worth over 1 billion in the last three years alone, the government amended the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) while only foot soldiers are caught, intelligence agencies believe fake currency is increasingly being used to fund terror in India.

The Army Commander didn’t rule out the possibility of Pakistan Army trying to facilitate infiltration attempts along the LoC under the cover of shelling and firing but maintained that the Counter Infiltration Grid of the Indian Army was well placed to thwart all designs of the Pakistani troops and the militants to infiltrate into the Indian Territory. Speaking to media persons on the sidelines of a function at 16 Corps Headquarters at Nagrota, Lt Gen Nimbhorkar said Pakistan Army continued firing and shelling targeting the civilian areas and forward posts along the LoC for past several days in the twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch. “Our troops have been giving befitting reply to Pakistan,” he added.

60988	2011	5	pakistan	It was reported that the armed forces will carry out a limited operation in North Waziristan Agency primarily targeting al Qaeda, TTP and foreign militants, as against the widely held belief that the focus will be exclusively on the Haqqani Network. Military commanders ruled out the possibility of a full scale operation like the one launched in South Waziristan and said it was ‘unfeasible’ because of difference in ground realities. South Waziristan, they said, was a “no go area” when they launched a major military offensive in October 2009 to flush out terrorists. “But the northern part has a massive presence of military and there are peace pacts with tribes that cannot be ignored.” A senior officer said, “The operation will be very selective and intelligence led.” The major target, it is said, will be the TTP militants who took refuge in North Waziristan after having been dislodged from south. “It will indeed be a big achievement if we succeed in neutralising some of the suicide bomber training centres,” added another officer.

We are still organised and strong. We (Taliban) are still loyal to our ‘chief’ Hakimullah Mehsud,” the message said. He said that since the killing of a major general in Upper Dir and the attack on a church in Peshawar the media had been criticising TTP and questioning their seriousness about negotiations although no ceasefire had yet been declared. Because no peace agreement had been finalised TTP’s attacks were continuing, he added. However, The News reported that Umer Khalid Khurasani has opposed peace talks with the Government. Khurasani said peace negotiations with the Government would never be successful as the TTP demand enforcement of ‘Shariah’ while the Government talks about the constitution. Khalid Khurasani said TTP wanted to replace the constitution and they would never backtrack even a single inch from their demand.

There is a need to constantly monitor these accounts. These accounts post propaganda material and also suggest routes and means on how to reach the IS camps, the officer also adds.

50301	2012	10	pakistan	With the Supreme Court still looking for solid evidence of an Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) backed political cell in the President House, yet another obstacle appeared before the apex court in the Asghar Khan case on October 15, reports The Express Tribune. A representative of Secretary to the President House Asif Hayat told the court that no record of such a political cell’s existence could be found during the tenure of former President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The President House office then sought time from a three judge bench to submit a detailed report in this regard, after going through decades old records. The bench, led by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, granted 48 hours to the President House to submit a comprehensive report. Counsel for former Air Chief Asghar Khan, Salman Akram Raja, said the material submitted before the bench was sufficient admission of “the gross violation of constitutional parameters”. Raja also questioned the role of military authorities at the time who took steps without constitutional and legislative backing. He emphasised that every country has a framework for the operation of a secret agency. Asghar Khan’s lawyer contended that the action was also a violation of Article 17 of the Constitution (which refers to a transparent political process). Further, Supreme Court, during the hearing of Asghar Khan’s petition on alleged distribution of INR 140 million among politicians by the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) to manipulate the general elections of 1990, observed that the armed forces’ officers were under oath not to take part in politics, reports Daily Times.

It also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for extending its support to the UPA government at the centre and favouring deployment of Army. The UAVs take real time images, find out about the guerrillas movements and their camps on the ground and send the data to the control room and in turn they are sent immediately to the forces participating in operations through modern devices , the paper said adding that small UAVs named Netra that run on rechargeable batteries are carried and used by the forces during the operations.

35251	2013	11	pakistan	Hakimullah Mehsud, the ‘chief’ of the Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was killed in a US drone strike in Dandy Darpakhel area, five kilometres (three miles) north of Miranshah, the main town of North Waziristan Agency (NWA) in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) on November 1, reports Dawn. Intelligence officials said Hakimullah was leaving from a meeting at a mosque in Dandy Darpakhel area when the drone targeted their vehicle. Five militants, including Abdullah Bahar Mehsud and Tariq Mehsud, both key militant commanders and close aides of the TTP chief, were also killed with two others injured in the drone strike, multiple sources confirmed. On November 2 morning (Today), Hakimullah Mehsud along with other militants killed in the drone strike, was buried in NWA, reports The News. Sources said that besides Hakimullah Mehsud, his uncle, driver and other aides buried at different places NWA. The Government has not yet confirmed the death of Hakimullah, reports The News. However, it has stopped the delegation from visiting NWA to hold peace talks following the reports of TTP chief s death. Strongly condemning the US drone attack in North Waziristan, Pakistan Government reiterated that these strikes are a violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. Foreign Office Spokesman Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry in a statement said that there was an across the board consensus in Pakistan that these drone strikes must end.According to the sources, TTP s Markazi majlis e Shoora (Central Advisory Committee) would appoint their new chief. The South Waziristan TTP chief, Khan Said Sajna alias Khalid is likely to succeed Hakimullah Mehsud as TTP chief. Chief of Mohmand Agency Umar Khalid Khurasani is also a strong contestant for the slot as he is the only surviving senior Taliban commander who had directly commanded operations under Hakimullah. Mullah Fazlullah, the chief of the Swat Taliban, is another senior TTP commander but unlikely to replace the assassinated TTP chief for not belonging to Mehsud clan. Jen Psaki, the spokesperson for the US State Department said that “We have seen those reports but we don’t have anything for you on that. The reports just came out. We have a close cooperative relationship with Pakistan on various issues, including counter terrorism but I do not have anything specific for you on Pakistan on this report.” Reacting to US drone strike, Pakistan Tehrik i Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan on November 1 demanded the Government to block NATO supplies going through the country, reports Dawn. Imran Khan further said that the US drone attack was as a conspiracy to sabotage talk’s effort. Earlier on October 31, Imran Khan issued a warning that his party will block the NATO supply line if the US made any drone strike to disrupt the talk’s process with the TTP. His party is set to table resolutions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Assembly and National Assembly on November 4 in this regard. Earlier on November 1, the TTP said that they have had “no contact” with the Government, a day after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said a process to initiate peace talks had been started, reports The Express Tribune. The TTP ‘spokesperson’ Shahidullah Shahid said that there had been no overtures. “No one has yet contacted us. The Government is making announcements only by media, no peace talks have yet been started,” Shahid said. “The beginning of peace talks means sitting at a table and discussing issues, no such thing has yet happened.”

50479	2012	10	pakistan	Pakistan jumped on October 25 into a war of words between Afghanistan and the United States over the legitimacy of Durand Line as an international border saying it was a “settled issue”, reports Dawn. “As far as the official response of the government of Pakistan is concerned, the Durand Line is a closed and settled issue. We regard it as the recognised international border, and the international community also recognises it so,” Foreign Office Spokesman Moazzam Khan said at the weekly media briefing. The Durand Line came into existence in 1893 through a treaty between Afghan King Amir Abdur Rahman and British Foreign Secretary Mortimer Durand to formalise the boundary between the two countries. In 1947, Durand Line began to serve as the international border between the newly created Pakistan and Afghanistan. While the Durand Line is internationally accepted as the border, Afghans have never accepted it. US Special Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Marc Grossman ignited a controversy last week when he told an Afghan private television channel that “our policy is that border is the international border”. There was never any ambiguity about US position over the Durand Line the 2,640 km long international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan but its reiteration by Ambassador Grossman at a time when Pakistan Afghan ties were at a nadir led to serious protests from Afghanistan, which has so far been maintaining an ambivalent position on the matter.
