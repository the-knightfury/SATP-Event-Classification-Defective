As far as Maoist affected areas were concerned, the Police would recruit tribal youth from these areas. It would provide some relaxation in education and other parameters while recruiting policemen in these areas. The Government would set up an Anti Terrorist Squad in the place of Anti Naxalite Force. This squad will be given training not only in dealing with terrorism but also jungle warfare.

Khan said the government should announce the names of the people killed in the attacks. “President Asif Zardari should tell the truth to the people about the drone victims and should not consider America as god,” he said. The administration stopped the ‘march’ when it had reached Manzai in the Tank Frontier Region after an overnight stay in Dera Ismail Khan.

The DGPR statement claimed, “All terrorists involved in high profile sectarian attacks committed in Punjab have been arrested, including sectarian target killers in Lahore.” It further stated, “Sectarian attacks reported in cities such as Chakwal, Bhakkar, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad were successfully investigated and the perpetrators arrested over the course of the past few months. By keeping these terrorists off the street, incidents of sectarian (violence) in Punjab have also been significantly reduced.” An unnamed senior official of the Punjab Police said that tracking down and arresting the proclaimed offenders involved in sectarian crimes was primarily the job of District Police Officers (DPOs). “In almost every meeting on the state of law and order in the Province chaired by the Punjab Inspector General the arrest of those wanted for sectarian violence topped the agenda,” he said.

There is a need to proceed with caution in all such cases because these people have sympathisers among powerful politicians, which also affects the ability of the Police to do its job, he added.

64351	2011	9	nepal	The US officials knew for a very long time that Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) had created various terrorist groups, including those based out from Nepal, to carry out attacks in India, according to the latest US cables released by Wikileaks, according to Indian Express. The US cables clearly show that Americans also knew that Tiger Memon, the prime accused in 1993 Mumbai blast case and an aide of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim, had tied up with the ISI. One of such organisations created by ISI in Pakistan was Jammu and Kashmir Islamic Front (JKIF), with its main base in Kathmandu, Nepal. To dispatch men and material and to execute explosions in India, Kathmandu was invariably made the nodal point and JKIF exploited the vulnerable Kathmandu based Kashmiri businessmen for such activities since they had a ready made and clean past. JKIF kingpin Javed Krawah himself used to run a carpet business in Kathmandu, said the US cable signed off by the then US Ambassador to India, Frank Wisner. The JKIF, says the cable dated July 8, 1997, was controlled from Pakistan by ISI and Memon. Their contact in Pakistan occupied Kashmir was Bilal Beg, who was running an indoctrination camp near Muzaffarabad, funded extensively by the ISI to carry out terrorist acts in India. One Colonel Farooq of Pakistan ISI tasked Bilal Beg and Tiger Memon to utilize Kathmandu based activists Lateef and Javed Krawah to set off blasts in Delhi before the Lok Sabha elections, it said. In May 21, 1996 this JKIF team set off a very high intensity explosion at Lajpat Nagar, in which 13 persons were killed and 40 injured. The RDX used in this blast was brought from Kathmandu, the cable said. The subsequent explosion in a Rajasthan roadways bus near Dausa on May 22, 1996 was also engineered by the JKIF. Another JKIF team under the leadership of Abdul Gani, AKA Assadullah, was sent to execute a bomb blast in Ahmedabad, it said. The JKIF again planned a chain of explosions in Delhi before Republic Day 1997 at the behest of ISI and Tiger Memon, the cable said. Since its inception, the JKIF had been under considerable pressure from its Pakistan based leadership to carry out bomb blasts outside Jammu and Kashmir, particularly in Delhi, the cable said.

The 26 year old is wanted by the US authorities over allegations that he provided material support to al Qaeda and conspired to use explosives.

In July 2010, Naseer was arrested again on a US arrest warrant. In January 2012, a judge approved Naseer’s extradition to the US.
