Bhatkal resident Ismail Abdul Rauf’s interrogation has given leads to investigators on missing links that could be a part of the large puzzle, including the alleged Islamic State (IS) fighter Shafi Armar alias Yousuf al Hindi, and how he purportedly funded to raise an Indian affiliated jihadi group through Dubai.Known as the centre of money laundering or hawala operations, Dubai, along with other countries in the Gulf region, houses a large Indian diaspora. Importantly, various armed groups, including the IS, in the ongoing conflict in Syria are funded through a network of private donations, collected from sheikhs, tribal leaders, influential ulemas and Arab diaspora based in Gulf countries. These two factors could be a starting point in unraveling the funding of Junood al Khalifa e Hind group outside the Indian territory by the Indians living in Gulf.Rauf had earlier travelled to Dubai 10 months ago to work as a labourer and came into contact with another Bhatkal resident, Ismail Nanda. During the time of their acquaintance, Nanda asked Rauf if he knew any hawala operators in Dubai and the latter gave contact of an operator, Abdullah Umaid. Officials investigating the case said Rauf was later contacted by Nanda and asked to check if Nadeem (code name for Sheikh’s hawala transaction) got the money. Rauf did not know who Mudabbir Sheikh was but it is believed that Nanda used the hawala operator in Dubai, suggested by Rauf, to make the transaction. Rauf was earlier a suspect in the case, but National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now made him a witness and is verifying the information provided by him. The agency is also making use of the mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) with Dubai to dig deep into Nanda s identity and find if he facilitated the hawala transactions to India at the behest of al Hindi or any other IS leader. If substantiated, it will take the investigation closer to proving that al Hindi used the IS group’s funds collected illegally by smuggling and selling oil, antiquities, collecting taxes from population living in its territory, ransom and selling Yezidi women as slaves among other methods to raise a module in India.",['Unknown Target'],['NotSpecified'],['Unknown Source']

In 2015, the Border Security Force (BSF) seized INR 2,60,82,000 of FICN from the Malda border alone and apprehended 24 couriers. Every day they are changing their modus operandi.

At least five agencies are now working together on FICN. However, the seized amount is only 10 per cent of the total flow, said a senior official of the committee. The couriers make 2 to 5 per cent on each consignment; profits are huge for those who run the trade. The kingpins get 50 per cent of the amount smuggled into India.

Around 280 companies of forces, including more than a hundred companies of central paramilitary forces, are now engaged in counter insurgency operations in the State. However, substantial number of forces was withdrawn from Assam following the last Assembly elections and that is why the State Government has requested the Centre to send additional forces to deal with the situation.The Special Director General of Police (Law and Order) Kula Saikia admitted that as the militant groups are not in a position to create trouble alone, they are trying to regroup and work under one umbrella. He said the militants are trying to shift their modus operandi and they have started to try and use more explosives. Another major shift is that the ultras are trying to use women cadres for transporting different materials. He said that in the last four months alone, at least 17 kilograms of explosives were recovered from the militants in different parts of the State.

The incidents of violence involving the militants also came down as only 30 such incidents were reported in the last four months. Replying to a question on the strategies adopted by the Police and SFs to improve the overall law and order scenario, Saikia said that bringing the Police closer to the common people is one of the major thrusts. He said that efforts are on to expand the concept of formation of citizens’ committees, which started in Guwahati in 1996.

This fact came out during the questioning of 14 suspected Islamic State (IS) sympathisers who were arrested last week from 12 places in six cities in a synchronized raid conducted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the sources added.

Having gone through the entire action plan, unfortunately, we did not find an answer to this simple and basic question.”India’s position is that while the action plan is “full of prescriptions” to member countries, it is low on what the UN will do in terms of assisting member states in this venture.

Even more important than what we face is how we respond to the threat,” he said. “What we are tackling is not merely a local problem that can be addressed unilaterally; it is a global contagion.

Justifying his statement the Justice Minister said the even the international media in foreign countries publish the information related to individuals joining the IS in order to suppress the terrorist acts. However, some websites are publishing false news reports and causing damage to the independence of the country s judiciary as well eroding the confidence of the public in the judicial system, the Minister pointed out. The Justice Minister charged that a small number of journalists are using the situation to spread false news reports and create a media mafia. The Minister had informed the Parliament on November 18 that 32 well educated Sri Lankan Muslims of four families have joined the IS in Syria.Earlier, the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka (MCSL) had strongly objected to the statement made by the Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe in Parliament regarding the Muslim community.

Some of the men are alleged to have joined or forced to join the fighting forces of ISIS. The Muslim community, including the Muslim Council, Jamiathul Ulema and other organizations cooperated with the government in identifying the families to provide the necessary support for the intelligence agencies to investigate. Those who have gone to Syria as quoted by Hon. Rajapakshe include women and children. he said. Ameen said the Minister s statement comes at a very opportune time to certain extremist elements bent on tarnishing the image of the Muslim community for reasons only best known to them. The Muslim community is seriously alarmed about the re emergence of the racist campaign that was carried out by extremist Buddhist monks since the end of the war in 2009.

Sabeer, allegedly linked to the Lashkar e Taiba (LeT), had fallen off the radar of investigating agencies after fleeing India on a fake passport in November 2008. He was also the former president of Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) in Kerala.His whereabouts have reportedly emerged now following investigations around K A Anoop, an alleged associate of Sabeer who was deported from the UAE in April, 2016. The NIA had arrested Anoop on April 8, 2016, after he was detained on his arrival at IGI Airport, New Delhi in connection with the September 2005 Kalamassery (Kochi) bus burning case. Sources familiar with the investigations claimed the two were in touch and that analysis of Anoop’s Dubai phone call records has revealed a number linked to Sabeer. “He has been trying to take his wife to Pakistan and has been offering 100,000 dirhams to obtain travel documents for her. This is the first time in many years that some information has emerged about Sabeer,” said sources.The NIA’s investigations in the 2008 case allegedly found that Sabeer had taken five youth — Fayas, Fayis, Abdul Rahim, Mohd. Yasin and Abdul Jabbar to Kashmir in September 2008 and handed them over to an LeT operative. The youths were allegedly being taken to an LeT camp for training but four of them were killed in an encounter with Indian security forces. Abdul Jabbar, the only one to escape, was later arrested by Kerala Police.The killing of the four and the investigations around their presence in Kashmir led investigators to unravel the mystery behind the Bengaluru blasts, which were allegedly executed withLeT funding, with Sabeer allegedly acting as the key Indian conduit in channelling funds and mobilising men for the Pakistan based terror organisation.According to the NIA, he used the passport of a daily wager, ShameerKollamkudyAlikutty, who is still living in Kerala, to escape. The NIA has found an airport departure card, which showed that he left for Dubai on an Air India flight. “In the departure card, the country of residence has been mentioned as the UAE whereas the occupation was written as sales executive,” the NIA says.

On seeing the police parties, the Maoists, who were armed with latest automatic weapons, opened fire on the police parties resulting in injuries to two Greyhound Commandos, and one of them died. Despite the police calling upon the Maoists to surrender, they did not pay heed to the warning and continued firing, constraining the police parties to retaliate by counter firing in self defence, the SP said. As a result of this firing incident, some Maoists died and some more escaped.

About deaths, the veteran Indian diplomat turned security expert says that between 1983 and 2009, 80,000 to 100,000 people, including combatants from both sides, lost their lives.

The war had also left 1.6 million land mines in the Northern and Eastern Provinces. But the real casualty of the war was Sri Lanka’s composite society, something that the LTTE and Sinhala chauvinism are “equally responsible for”, Menon says. “Sri Lanka’s democracy was flawed by disappearances, killings, torture, detention, and widespread human rights abuses committed by all sides in the war. Civil military relations were skewed, Sinhala society was militarized, and the brutalized remnants of Tamil civil society were leaderless, without direction or hope.

Experts cautioned that the declining number didn’t mean New Delhi has become less vulnerable to attacks, especially from Pakistan based militant outfits such the Jaish e Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar e Taiba (LeT). The Jaish and Lashkar enjoy patronage from the Pakistani establishment and army, and are involved in this year’s Pathankot air base and Uri army camp attacks in which about two dozen Indian soldiers were killed. Pakistan denies the charge.The Intelligence Bureau (IB) and Research and Analysis Wing (R AW) alerted Delhi Police 306 times about possible terrorist attacks since 2012, which recorded the highest number of warnings at 77. In comparison, only 29 alerts have surfaced till September, 2016 a Delhi Police response to a right to information query revealed. “Broadly, we can divide these inputs into two parts. One is of general nature. Say possibilities of attack during Independence Day and Republic Day. We circulate these inputs to keep our forces on the toes,” a senior Delhi police officer said. He added, “The second type is specific. For instance, X person is coming to Delhi and staying in a particular hotel. We investigate and report back to the agency about the authenticity of the alert. No information is available on the authenticity of each and every alert.”Another aspect attributed to the decreasing alerts is the growing presence of Islamic State (IS) and al Qaeda sympathizers, and home grown militants. Intelligence agencies don’t share alerts in such cases, but take action with the help of local Police. Delhi Police arrested about a dozen militants in 2016; among them six IS sympathisers and two are from the al Qaeda in Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). “None of them came directly from Pakistan. Agencies get information about Pakistan based terrorist through local informers and technical intervention such as call interception, including months of work such as data encryption as ISIS members interact through social media,” an officer said. Such cases go beyond the realm of alert, but invite actionable input that requires direct collaboration between the intelligence agency and police to arrest the militant. “That explains why number of terrorism related alerts is going down, though IS members are getting arrested increasingly,” the officer said.",['Unknown Target'],['NotSpecified'],['Unknown Source']

Narendra Modi went to Pakistan and Pathankot happened. Now Pakistan is fuelling unrest in the Valley,” she said, adding India has extended hand of friendship to Pakistan sincerely but it was not reciprocated by the neighbouring country.Taking on the separatists and other “influential people” fuelling unrest in Kashmir, Mehbooba charged them with “driving innocent children and youth” to the path of violence by making them stone pelters and forcing them to target Security Forces (SFs) and camps and Police Stations but, at the same time, sending their own kin to different parts of India for studies. “What we will do with the Medical and Engineering Colleges, if they don’t produce doctors and engineers if the vested interests continue to drive children and youth to the path of stone pelting”?, she asked saying the Colleges are meant for studies to produce professionals and it should be duty of all right thinking people to send their wards to the educational institutions and not the “institutes of stone pelters”. “Students shouldn’t be on the roads. Their place is in the educational institutions. If the students continue to be on the roads, there will be no doctors and engineers,” she said.Taking “perpetrators of violence” to task, the CM called upon them to come forward and don’t hide behind the shield of youth and children. “Let them come forward and show their real face to the people of Kashmir that they are making the innocent youth and children stone pelters by ruining their careers of education,” she said, declaring that there will be no talks with those indulging in violence or instigating the youth to the path of stone pelting. “We will hold talks only with those, who give up the violence”. The CM said some people are trying to take advantage of Kashmir unrest in the State and indulging in encroachments in the Valley while in Jammu also, the vested interests have started indulging in such illegal activities.

As people were engaged in protest rallies in Kashmir, some miscreants took advantage of it,” she said, adding shops and houses were illegally constructed and wood from forests was being smuggled. “We have only land that is available to us where we can make projects in the future,” the CM said.

In the final report of the case filed before the NIA Court, the NIA has included Dawood Ibrahim’s henchman Aftab Batki, who heads the FICN network of the gang, as accused. A red corner notice by the Interpol is pending against Aftab.The conspiracy pertaining to the smuggling of fake currency notes through the Nedumbassery airport started in October 2012. It all began when Manjeri native Kunjumuhammad who was lodged in the Arthur Road Prison, Mumbai, in connection with a narcotic case struck a deal with Kasargode native K M Abdullah who was accused in the sensational Hamza murder case. “Abdullah gave Kinjumuhammed the mobile number of Aftab, who handles Dawood’s fake currency business across India with many cases pending against him,” stated the NIA report.Later, Abdullah introduced Kunjumuhammed to Antony Das of Valparai, Coimbatore, and Perinjanam native Muhammed Haneefa, and they hatched the conspiracy to smuggle high quality fake currency notes from the Gulf to India. In October 2012, Antony Das invested 4 lakh for the operation, and sent the money to Kunjumuhammed who was in West Asia.Kunjumuhammed then contacted Aftab in Pakistam and arranged the fake Indian currency notes that were in the safe custody of Mohammed Haneefa in Dubai. Later, Kunjumuhammed arranged Abid Chullikulavan as carrier of the fake currency notes with the help of Abdul Salam, and offered him 50,000 as commission. In January 2013, Customs officials arrested Abid when he arrived at the Nedumbassery airport with the fake Indian currency notes, handed over to him by Antony Das.According to the NIA report, “counterfeiting of high quality Indian currency notes is rampant by Dawood Ibrahim’s crime syndicate, with the aim of weakening the Indian economy.” A former NIA official said investigation of many cases registered in other parts of country had established the nexus between Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and Dawood’s crime syndicate. “The fake notes are printed using highly sophisticated machines set up exclusively for the purpose.
